JC mr.Corbyn it's over to you Thank You Julie and to everyone watching this debate
tonight this election gives you a real choice about your future the future of your community 
and of our country labour is offering real change and real hope wewill build a fairer Britain that cares
for all where wealth and power are shared the Conservative government is failing it's failed on the economy on
the climate crisis the National Health Service and on brexit we will get brexit sorted by giving you the people the
final say and implement whatever you decide too many families are without a proper home struggling to make ends meet
while tax cuts are handed to the super-rich we can do better than this with a Labour government on your side a
Labour government for the many not just the few mr. Corbyn 

BJ: there's only one reason why we're having this election that is that we have a deadlocked Parliament that will not
deliver brexit and whether you voted for leave or remain people want to get a brexit done and to unleash the potential
of this entire country and we conservatives can because if you vote for us we have a deal that is ready to go
approved by every one of the 635 conservative candidates standing at this election and as soon as we can get that
deal through Parliament as we can in the next few weeks we can get on with the people's priorities and that's the
choice dither and delay deadlock and division under a Corbin Sturgeon coalition with two referendums another one on the EU
and then another one on Scotland or we can end this national misery break the deadlock get brexit done and make 2020
year of prosperity and growth where we invest in our NHS and deal with the cost of living together let's take this country forward

Q: well we invited viewers from right across the country to submit questions we've selected the questioners and they
are in the studio with us this evening the two leaders don't know what they'll be asked also here the people who will
listen to tonight's debate some have voted conservative and some labour in the past and some have voted for other
parties across the UK and our first question tonight comes from Kath Sherlock from Bradford Cass both of you
have promised that we're exit will be resolved in the next few months but you're really telling us the truth there
have been so many broken promises can you reassure me that we will not be talking about this forever thank you

BJ: for brexit to respond first mr. Johnson well thank you very much Kath and yes we
certainly will come out on January the 31st because we have a deal that as I say is oven ready it's ready to to go
and it's approved as I say and not just by our friends and partners in the EU but by every one of the 635 conservative
candidates and it delivers everything that we wanted from brexit our whole country comes out entire and perfect England
Scotland Wales Northern Ireland together and there is a sharp distinction between what we are proposing getting brexit
done unleashing the potential of this country and next year dither and delay with another referendum on the EU when Jeremy Corbyn mr. colbey
cannot tell us which side he would campaign on okay thank you mr. Johnson 

JC:  our priority is obviously to get it sorted we will within three months negotiate a credible leave option with the European
Union and with the six months put that to a referendum of the British people to decide between that option of leaving
whilst protecting jobs and trade and the Good Friday Agreement with Europe all remaining as full members of the European Union that will be the choice
put before the British people the idea that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson's deal can be dealt with and finished by
the end of January is such nonsense what he's proposing is a trade deal with the United States that would take at least seven years to
negotiate whilst at the same time saying he would negotiate a special trade deal with the European Union the two things
are actually incompatible Thank You mr. Corbyn 


Q:mr. Johnson said that he claims he has a deal that is ready to go that you would have to negotiate a new deal after three
years since we voted to lead the European Union on that point how would you respond 

JC: well the Prime Minister Boris Johnson voted twice against Theresa May Mays deal one time for it
then proposed his own deal which narrowly got through the House of Commons with the support of the DUP
which is actually even worse than heresa Mays deal he cannot protect jobs in this countryon that basis and I think it is time
that we actually recognize we have to maintain a firm and good trading relationship with Europe otherwise more
jobs will be lost all over the country as they already been lost because of the uncertainty 

BJ: well we have a great deal that is supported as mr. Corbyn says not just by many members of his own party
but by the entire conservative party now and 635 conservative candidates have backed it and what is the alternative
it's it's under Jeremy Corbyn the Labour Party to consecrate next year to a three-month extension in which he would
and mr. Coburn proposes to negotiate a new treaty and then to put that to the people in a referendum but we don't know
and I've asked this before we don't know on which side mr. Corbyn would campaign is he going to campaign for leave can
re

JC:very clearly we will we will negotiate we will negotiate an agreement and we'll put that alongside remain in a
referendum and our government will abide by that result I will carry out the result of that referendum there will be
a genuine choice put before the people of Britain to make their decision and we will carry it out 

BJ: at this election what we're asking is for a mandate to govern and mr. Corbin is asking the people for
a mandate to conduct a new negotiation next year when we don't need one because we've already got a deal I think what
people need to understand is whether he believes in the deal that he is proposing to do does he actually want to
do this deal because if he doesn't believe in it or if absurdly he was then going to campaign against it in the
could you now tell us are you going to campaign for leave or remain 

JC: I want to bring people together therefore there will be a referendum in which that decision will
be made by the British people and our government will abide by that decisionwhen you say you'll get it done really
mr. Johnson you are going to embark on probably seven years of negotiations with the United States on a trade deal
you've already indicated that you will allow our national health service to be put at risk by a trade deal with the
United States you've already indicated that you would do a Canada style agreement which took at least seven
years to negotiate so you're not going to get it done in a few months and you know that perfectly well

Q: I'm noting I'm noting here of course that we haven't heard whether you would campaign for remain or it's leaving that
situation but it is important that we put the point that you have just made directly to mr. Johnson about this
timetable let's have a look at the timetable you reckon you can get your divorce deal done and a trade deal done
by December 2020 do you stick on a pledge on that deadline of December 2020 have you dug yourself in 

BJ: yes absolutely because people said people don't forget people said that we couldn't do a new
deal in three months people said that they would never open up the treaty they said it was impossible to do actually we
succeeded we have a great new deal as I say is oven ready ready to go and I hearwhat Jeremy Corbyn meet a new coin for December 2020
I hear what people say about to do a fantastic free trade deal with our friends and partners in the EU because
we're already in a state of perfect alignment both on tarriffs and on quotas and we still have not heard Judy you will make
but there is a glaring lacunae still in this debate we still campaign for the deal he proposes to do or is he going to invite his labor
colleagues to despair 

JC: We need three months to negotiate six months for a referendum and that will bring that process to an end what we know of the
government's proposals what we know of what mr. Johnson has done is a series of secret meetings with the United States
in which they were proposing to open up our NHS markets as they call them to American companies Freedom of Information Act request was made in
order to find out what happened at these meetings that's what happened to these meetings every single line of this
document redacted out a document here a document here of US UK negotiations summary of specific negotiations
missiles market access for us products to our National Health Service you're going to sell out our NHS to the United States

BJ: This is an absolute invention it is completely untrue there are no circumstances whatever in which this government or any
Conservative government will put the NHS on the table in any trade negotiation our NHS will never be for sale and I'm
amazed how often this conduct the only reason that it comes up is because mr. Corbyn is trying to conceal the void at
the heart of his brexit policy and refusing to answer the question of which side which side he would take the public have a right
to know.

JC: just very briefly made the position clear we will have a referendum abide by
that result it's a British Minister has claimed the NHS is not under threat
we're going to come to the NHS very shortly his government agree with the
u.s. that there should be in the terms of negotiations full market access for the
United States 

Q: We will discuss the NHS a little further a little later and we're now going to go to our
next questioner staying with the issue of brexit John Firth wants to ask about the possible threat to the Union which
could mean the breakup of the United Kingdom John is the Union worth
sacrificing for brexit thank you very much indeed for that is the Union worth
sacrificing for brexit 

JC - mr corbyn well I hope the Union is not going to be broken up or sacrificed in this way but the
agreements that the Prime Minister negotiated or he's put not negotiate he's put towards the mature Parliament
was about creating a border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland creating a different customs arrangement
for Northern Ireland with the rest of Ireland having promised to the Democratic Unionist Party he would never
do that clearly there is an issue there clearly there are issues all around about this deal that he's proposed and I do think
that this deal is damaging to this country damaging to the rights we have at work and consumer protection and
environmental protection in this country and very damaging to manufacturing industry jobs all over Britain some of
which of already uncertainty over Brexit

BJ -  you have a deal that keeps the whole of the UK together as we come out of the EU and of course Jeremy Corbyn and the
Labour Party let being no doubt about it in order to secure power and the keys to number 10 are we going to do a deal they
probably already have done a deal with the sturgeon and the SNP to form a Corbin sturgeon coalition and the price
of that deal the price of Nicolas sturgeons support let's being know that she's made it absolutely clear would be
a second referendum on the union with Scotland I don't think we need another referendum on the Union miss : I ruled
that we had won in 2014 the people of Scotland voted very substantially to stay in the most successful political
partnership over the last 300 years why put this country this great country through another referendum on Scotland
and why have a second referendum

Q- is the Union more important than brexit yes or no 

JC - I think I ought to be able to reply to this nonsense there's not gonna be a coalition of
labour and anybody else there are no deals that been done and there will be
no deals that are done okay for clarity is the Union more important from than
brexit mr. Cobb India our country is obviously very very important and we
have to bring this business to a close and that's why we're proposing a trade deal with Europe or staying in one or
the other as a way of bringing this
issue to a close thank you 

BJ - the Union is of course the most important thing just water the question it's a fantastic I'm proud to be not a
prime minister also Minister for the now let's be clear that Jeremy Corbyn has said that he's open to a second
referendum on Scotland early in the lifetime of next pilot if he's head of the government and a Nicola Sturgeon has
made it absolutely clear that the price of her support will be a referendum on Scotland in 2020 so you're going to have
a year of two referendums one on Scotland and one 

Q- if you do have to get to a point where you have to make a deal with the SNP Nicola Sturgeon has already
said don't pick up the phone unless you can guarantee a second independence referendum can you rule it out before
the end of the first year I've said there would be no deal with the SNP that would be no support for a Scottish
referendum in the early years the next Labour government because I want to invest in Scotland and give Scotland the
70 billion it needs in capital investments see if the SNP choose to put the conservative government back in
office with its austerity programme that's their choice

BJ -  listen very carefully as always do to mr. Corbyn I didn't hear him say he was going to rule
out a referendum on Scotland did did you what were ruling out a referendum it's perfectly clear support for the chaotic
coalition that he would comprise

JC- 9 years of chaotic coalition already

Q -can I turn please to the issue of northern ireland in your statements in your leadership
race mr. Johnson you said under no circumstances whatever happens where I allowed the EU or anyone else to create
any division down the Irish Sea you spoke to another conference a year ago saying that that would damage the fabric
of the Union and now here we have your deal that you've presented to Parliament 

BJ - absolutely and that deal means that the whole of the UK can come out and do free
trade deals around the world and do a great deal with our EU friends and partners Northern Ireland included what
the people of Northern Ireland trade deal down the Irish straight trade border down the aisle Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the
UK it's it's there in in black and white and what the people of Northern Ireland do not know and they can part of our
tariff schedules and and everything else well the people in Ireland is what kind of deal Jeremy Corbyn proposes
to do we still don't know by the way he is in favour again just said 

JC - is that he said exactly the opposite when he spoke to a DUP conference you said there would be no border down the Irish Sea well
there is on the country 

BJ - the hop on the country the whole of the UK comes out entire and perfect as I have said we do free trade deals together we take back
control again we have our own immigration take back control of our borders and one of the many mysteries
about mr corbyn's deal okay is would he take back control of immigration Thank You mr. Johnson

Q - we're going to stay on this issue or brexit and underlying this whole issue of course is the question of trust and
leadership we have had hundreds of questions on this and with that in mind it's over this whole
nation will have watched you both throughout this campaign in utter despair at the heart of all of this is
one very simple question how can we trust you under under your leadership the debate
has become toxic and degraded with an appalling level of Lies and childish abuse how can this nation how can this
nation trust you to have the personal integrity and individual strength of character to look after our country's
interest rescue us from this mess and bring us back together

BJ - I will thank you very much for a very important question and on the issue of trust I think that trust in
politics and and in Parliament has been corroded and that is the most fundamental reason for that is because
Parliament asked the people to vote on membership of the EU and then Parliament has repeatedly refused to honor that
promise to respect Jeremy Corbyn in the Labor Party are now blocking Brexit it the way I think - it's absolutely true the way to restore
trust in politics is to get bricks it done and move forward we have a great deal that enables us to do it I'm
unclear thank you why it's necessary to spend another year wait about brexit

JC - Trust is something that has to be earned and as a public representative you have to listen to the
people that elected you in the first place and you have to listen to people all over the country in all walks of
life I spend a great deal of time traveling around the country listening to people be they chief executives
workers people sweeping the street or the homeless everybody you meet know something you don't know leadership is
about listening to people trying to put their ideas into practice and finally come to a decision which you can take a
country and our society forward my style of leadership is actually to listen to people and try and bring consensus
together in my own party and obviously within Parliament because the issues weface of duplicating our society do have
to be conquered they're not going to beconquered by diktats but only by listening and taking us forward

Q:  very specific in this question how can the nation trust you to have the personal integrity and the individual
strength of character 

JC: mr. Corben how would you respond to that particular point I think we have to represent people take decisions and be honest with
people about why you're taking adecision that you are and how to bring people together my whole strategy on
brexit has been to recognize whether you voted remain and live in a private rented accommodation and import and in
London voted leave and you live in the north and in the same situation your issues are the same the problems of
poverty inequality and division within our society bring people together don't divide them 

BJ - look at what I have said I'm going to do as a politician and look what I'd look what I've delivered
whether it's as mayor of London or now as Prime Minister I said that we would put 20,000 and more police officers on
the streets of our city and we are of our country and we are recruiting them now I said we'd upgrade 20 hospitals and
have 40 new hospitals that program is going ahead we are uplifting funding for education across the country we're
lifting up the living wage by its biggest ever expansion I said we would deliver brexit and we will deliver
breakfast thank you we can actually do it that's right clear thank you

Q - Thank You mr. Johnson personal integrity an individual character does the truth matter in this
election 

BJ - I think it does and I think it very important I think it's very important to hear from I've been very
clear about the deal that I've done there it is it's in black and white you can read it we don't know we don't know
what took mr. Corbyn is come clean he won't come clean with the electorate 

JC - I think we've been very clear on our policies in relation to Europe I think we're also very clear on all the
other policies that be unveiled in our manifesto on Thursday and there will be accompanied by a fully costed gradebook
with it so every pledge we make will be fully funded because I believe the British people deserve that knowledge deserve to know what we're going to do
and deserve a government that is actually not going to preside over rising homelessness increasing
inequality and chaos in the NHS instead of going to invest in the future of this country 

Q - Will you take personal responsibility for the way the
debate is unfolded in politics in this country we know of course mr. Johnson that people point to the fact that you
promised 40 times on record we'd be out of the EU on October the 31st one of your former chief of staff's from your
time as London Mayor said that you'd betrayed every person you'd ever had any dealings with and we know mr. Corbin
there are big questions about anti-semitism within labor for example we know that you and your allies have
been responsible for turning our once-great party into anassessment of anti-semitism were their words can
you take some responsibility for the way the debate has turned in this country

JC - anti-semitism is absolute evil and scourge within our society racism in any form is a scourge in our society I have
taken action in my party where anyone has committed any anti-semitic acts or made any anti-semitic statements they
are either suspended or expelled from the party and we've investigated every single case we do take this very very
seriously indeed because I do not want to live in a society where racism is rife I understand and recognize the
history of the desperate history of the Jewish people in the 20th century which came about from an unrestricted of
anti-semitism in the 1920s we've got to stand up against racism in any form in our society

Q- On the question of telling the truth in politics mr. Johnson your response to
that the points that I put you on those

BJ - issues well I just want to say on Jeremy and anti-semitism thatit's a complete failure
of leadership what's happened in the Labour Party with anti-semitism and but the failure of leadership is even worse
when you look at what is happening on their brexit policy because want to hear okay what they want to hear is clarity
about whether he believed in the deal proposing

Q-  this was a question from Farhad about personal integrity and character so let's just try to take stock before we go for the ad break there are many
people and many politicians indeed that feel that the nastiness of political debate in this country has simply got out of control will you two tonight look
at one another and no matter who becomes Prime Minister make a gesture to improve
things today could you make a pledge and promise that whoever comes to power improves the debate in parliament

JC -  the debate in Parliament before theright before Parliament was dissolved was vicious and horrible and some
terrible remarks are made particularly -and about women MPs I asked the speaker to convene a meeting at all party
leaders mr. Johnson sent a representative there and we agreed this was unacceptable conduct we might
absolutely agree with that thank you

Q- back to our debate let's have our next question and it comes from OMA shall hub and it's on the NHS I'm a hospital doctor and I
see firsthand the unsustainable pressure on the NHS elderly patients stuck on trolleys in corridors unacceptably long
waiting times for operations aside from pledging more money for the health service how will you ensure that the health service can meet future
demands and would they involve any privatization doctor thank you very much indeed for first response

JC - mr. Corbyn I think the NHS is a wonderful and brilliant institution but it is suffering under the most incredible
pressure the staff are unbelievably stressed by the job they have to do andbthe insufficiency of facilities to deal
with it there are 33,000 nurse vacancies at the moment in the NHS I'll give astory yesterday the woman friend of mine
died at 6:30 yesterday morning from secondary breast cancer the day before she'd gone to hospital at the
recommendation of her GP in order to get urgent treatment she waited 8 hours the nurses that were trying to help her were
unable to get anyone to see her because they were under such strain and stress and so she recorded a video saying
please in my memory make sure nobody else goes through this pain we've got to fund our NHS properly and fill the
vacancies and make sure it's there for all time it's one of the most civilized things about this country thank you

BJ - thank you oh my and I agree passionately with what you've said about the NHS it's absolutely vital that we support it and
it is one of the single most beautiful and brilliant things about Britain and about our society and we are determined
to fund it not just now but for the long term in this one nation Conservative government were putting record sums in 34 billion pounds we are as I said
earlier on we're not just upgrading 20 hospitals but we are building 40 new hospitals as a result of the decisions
taken by this government we will invest in GPS we'll have fat tens of thousands more nurses 6 hours and more GPS and our
objective is to have a health service that is not just better for doctors and nurses but better for patients as well
thank you can thank you that only if we have a strong economy thank 

JC -  indeed that's the problem is that the AME performance is now at its worst ever four million people waiting for
operations there are all the vacancies that have not been filled within the NHS
the Health and Social Care Act allows the privatization of services and indeed we have the nonsense of our National
Health Service being taken to court by private operators because they didn't get contracts from it let's end the
privatization within the NHS

BJ -  we are investing taxed we are investing and privatizing the NHS nor do
we have any certain of course we are nor will be NHS just let me repeat this point nor will the NHS be ever up for sale in any
negotiation let me repeat that we will continue to fund the NHS massively as we are we can only do so
because we have a strong and dynamic economy which is and by the don't forget that under labour they ruined the public
finances they did himself was there was no money left the economy has grown every year in the last nine years and
what could be more notice what could be more ruinous for the NHS than a crackpot plan for a four-day week which would

Q - respond this is the proposal for a four-day week for workers across the
economy 

JC - it is about reducing the working week all across the economy paid for by productivity increases all across Britain works
Landro we've got another motor well people need to be aware that actually a shorter working week is probably a good
thing for their health and well-being as he's decent pay I would also say mr.Branton is that his proposal for 40 new
hospitals which he grandly announced in July turns out to be six reconfigurations without any clarity with where they're actually going to be

BJ - that is totally untrue we're putting we're doing 20 upgrades and yes it is true that we are starting with six butthe seed funding has gone in so where
does the 40 come from 40 new hospitals in the investment the investment is going in now and the only reason that
investment can be made is because we have a robust economy and let me get we make another point the single biggest
threat to our economy and our ability to fund the NHS is our failure to get Brexit done

Q - specific moment we are talking about the NHS on the issue of privatization and
private provision with the NHS sometimes it is there provided by organizations that are not provide profit it has
extended capacity within the NHS will you rule out any privatization in the NHS any private provision within the NHS

JC - under the principle is to ensure that all people that work in the NHS are employed by the NHS on similar contracts
across the NHS the internal market must go within the NHS and what is happening is privatization of services
of services across the NHS and I think that is very very damaging to the whole principles of the NHS we also have
problems of Social Care which are not being addressed either and there are about a million people in the Social

Q- one quick answer mr. Johnson will there be a policy on Social Care in yourmanifesto yes or no 

BJ - yes there will and we think that nobody should pay for their cost of their Social Care by
selling their home and everybody should have dignity and security in their older

Q- now of course you will have heard that both have made significant spending pledges over the past couple of weeks
and not just on the NHS and Beverly Davis from Newport as a question related to this Bevin I'm a care home laundry
assistant during a minimum wage I worked all my life and have seen the real impact of austerity which neither of you
have now you say there's plenty to spend I'm concerned because neither of you have ever had to worry about money
you'll throw it away on silly election giveaways what can you say to reassure me 

JC - We had austerity for nine years in this country we've had a growth of billionaires in this country we've had a
growth of extreme poverty in this country we've had a growth of personal debt from people trying to look after
children look after older people I think the first thing has to be an increase in wages by having a ten-pound on our
living wage for all people and any to zero hours and enter zero hours contracts and an investment strategy across the country that does give us an
increase in manufacturing jobs all across Britain which we're not having at the present time I think this election
is a turning point in the way in which going to we're going to manage our economy in the future thank you mister

BJ - the question directly about how we're handling public finances in this electoral period I I would just point
out that I have shelved a plan to cut corporation tax saving it's already the lowest in Europe II would whack it up tothe highest in in your beliefs beliefs
we've shelved that cut that puts again gives us the ability to put another six billion pounds into the NHS and other
priorities and we will do that we can do that because we have a strong economy and what worries me about this country
at the moment is that we are going to continue with this pointless paralysis I'm have notion know I know the hesitation repeating this point if we go
on with more deadlock and division next year thanks you failed to get brexit done then the economy will suffer

Q-  that is very specific she's saying now there seems to be plenty to spend she is
concerned that because neither you've had to worry about money or throws away on silly election giveaways can we have
a pledge here from both of you simply is austerity over in the United Kingdom 

JC - mr. Corbyn we will that we will end austerity I'm absolutely clear about that 

BJ - yes and I believe in spending investing massively in our public services because we support and which is
what we are doing but because we support creating sector and that's why it's a good idea actually to believe in
business to support us to support the state sector Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party have actually said that
they want to overthrow capitalism and to destroy the basis of wealth creation in this country I have to say I think that
would be disaster for this country

JC - We will increase corporation  tax to around the levels it was in 2010 in order to reinvest properly in
education in order to pay for the ending of university tuition fees to give every student a decent chance of going to
university redress the grotesque levels of imbalance in our society we are a society of billionaires and the very
poor neither of which are right 

Q - both of you are proposing extraordinary levels of borrowing at the last election we were told by your predecessor mr.
Johnston that there was no magic money tree have you found a magic money tree mr. Johnson and have you found perhaps
more than one of them  

BJ - mr. Corbyn here is operating  in a money Forrest We are well operating within strict fiscal discipline and yes of course were investing now in the NHS and we're
investing in our policing and investing in education because we have the fiscal Headroom to do so we're also going to do
fantastic things for this country with infrastructure with uniting the whole country with with better high-speed rail
with telecommunications we'll do fantastic things for this country you can only do that if interest rates are
low and the rate of which in the country responds to 

JC - the reality where reality of austerity has been to hit the the funds of local authorities has meant the life
chances of children have been damaged by underfunding schools head teachers going out collecting money in order to keep a
school going young people with no after-school clubs no youth centre to go to and the levels of dislocation and
poverty in so many areas of Britain deliberately because of austerity must and will change yes we will invest in
education invest in housing all of it gentlemen

Q -  all of this Duncan is of course predicated on what sort of brexit deal either view might be able to
achieve but we're going to move on to some other subject matters now in our debate something a little different
we've had hundreds and hundreds of questions from ICB views and now we're going to have a quick-fire section on a
wide variety this year so try to learn a little bit more about where the leaders stand on those other issues so if you
could say in a few words as possible perhaps even a yes or no gentleman given that we're looking at the clock that we
define a few words well just what is editing 1 2 or just give us a clear precise answer with first question is
suit from leads is the monarchy fit for purpose 

Jeremy Corbyn-  needs a bit of improvement

BJ - the institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach 

Q- its Prince Andrew fit for purpose

JC -  before we discuss Prince Andrew I think we should discuss the victims that are there because of whatever strand is doing very very
serious questions that must be answered and nobody should be above the law but the primary position ought to be the
proper treatment of those people who are victims of the most appalling behavior by apparently Epstein and many others
thank you very much indeed 

mr. Johnson - I think all our sympathies which should be obviously with the victims of Jeffrey
Epstein and the enormous will certainly take its course 

Q- of course thank you very much indeed of course and we know that we've heard from
Prince Andrew this week and we'll move on now to our next question from Andrew from Liverpool do you agree that climate
change is the biggest issue in our country today mr. Johnson

BJ -  I think it's a colossal issue for the entire world and the UK the UK is neeti is meeting that
challenge with the most far-reaching ambition to get to carbon neutral by 2050 we need to get Brexit done

JC - poorest people in the poorest countries lose out because of lose out because of flooding and unusual weather patterns
when we have unusual weather patterns in this country when we have extreme levels of air pollution we have to have a green
industrial revolution where we invest for the future in sustainable industries and jobs and prevent the continuing
damage to our natural world and our environment

Q-  which current this is a question from Tony from Bristol which current foreign
leader do you most admire mr. Johnson 

BJ - leader well very good question I think I like the eu-27 all of them because I
they gave me a fantastic deal

JC - The leader I admire most at the present time the present time is the general
secretary  general of the United Nations who is trying to bring the world together okay

Q - thank you very much okay we are didn't get quite through as many as we thought we might gentlemen but we're going to have before our concluding statements
perhaps time for one more short seasonal question and this is from Ben West in Kent I think we should all learn to be a
little more a little more kind to each other including those we disagree with with this in mind and leaving politics aside
for a moment what present would you leave under the Christmas tree for each other this year

JC - what gift would you lead leave for mr. Johnson to the Christmas well well I know mr.
Johnson likes a good read so what I would probably leave under the tree for him would be a Christmas Carol by
Charles Dickens and I think he would realize how nasty scrooge was

BJ - I'd leave a copy of my brilliant brexit deal maybe maybe by next year well I think mr. mr. Corbin
shares my love of okay plants and trees I think maybe soon Jack thank you very much indeed 

Q- Closing statement

JC -  mr. Corbyn first you've seen tonight the real choice you'll have in this electionand your voice must be heard if you
haven't registered a vote please go online and do it now this is a once in a generation election to end privatisation
and gives the National Health Service the funding it needs to give people the final say and get brexit sorted to
tackle the climate emergency that threatens our futures to invest in good jobs in every region and nation of our
country I ask that you vote for hope and vote for labour on the 12th of December

BJ  -  mr. Johnson let's jump to our choice is very simple we can get brexit done or we can spend another groundhog year with another
referendum when mr. core views heard tonight cannot answer the fundamental question is he is he for remain or leave and what price would he's pay to secure
Nicola sturgeons support to enter number 10 if he can't answer those questions tonight I don't think he's fit to lead our country so let's end the dither and the deadlock
and if we have a working majority are a conservative majority I pledge we will have a parliament that works for you that 
focuses on the NHS and the cost of living because when we get brexit done by January 31st we will go forward as the United and confident nation that has
shown our faith and judgment
