Corbyn: The issues of your views on rights and freedoms in our society. I absolutely support the right to freedom of speech; I supported the introduction of the human rights act; I support the convention on human rights. Freedoms and rights in a democracy are very very important, I’ve spent my life getting into hot water for defending people because I believe their human rights should not be violated and that’s the kind of government I intend to lead that does guarantee democracy. 
Question: Why do you think this man is frightened of you being given power?
Corbyn: Well I can’t understand everything that goes on in your mind that makes you say that, I would say, I want to live in a society where we do deal with the worst aspects of poverty in our society, we do invest properly in our schools, we do give all our children a real chance and we have a health service that is really there for all of us at all time, that’s the agenda I’ve spent my life dealing with. The gentleman that asked the question about businesses on the question of public ownership which you rightly raised, our proposals are that we will take our railways that were invested and built by the rest of us back into public ownership, we will take royal mail back into public ownership as it’s a natural monopoly and our water industry which has been asset stripped to within an inch of its life by many of these water companies and wastes a great deal of water will come back into public ownership, which will be run with consumer and worker involvement. The new announcement we made last week was on broadband because I believe the government’s proposals are insufficient, only 10 % of households in the UK get access to fiber optic broadband we will make that 100 % within 10 years, starting with the remote areas that have the least access at the moment. 

Question: Mr. Corbyn I heard you talking about free speech and human rights and I have two young daughters and what terrifies me as I look at labor Members of Parliament, female Members of Parliament, they’ve been driven out of the party, I watch a video on YouTube with Ruth Smith, particularly because I am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt if its people acting in your name. But I watched a video with Ruth Smeeth who was in a press conference with you and Ruth Smeeth a Jewish MP was heckled out of a press conference, its online its on YouTube, and there you are at the end of the press conference chatting happily with that very same heckler I don’t buy that whole nice old grandpa, I see that video and it tells me all I need to know and I am terrified for my daughters because I see what you did in that video, and I don’t understand how you can say you stand up for human rights and freedom when that’s how you support a Labour MP at a Labour press conference. I think its disgraceful.
Corbyn: Nobody should suffer any abuse in public life or private life clear. Nobody should suffer abuse and many Labor MPs Ruth Smeeth and others have suffered the most unbelievable levels of abuse and it was a labor MP Jo Cox who was murdered because she stood up in public life. I simply say to you that bad behavior, misogyny, racism of any sort is absolutely not acceptable in any form whatsoever in my party or in our society.
Question: Then why, and its online, were you talking happily with a smile on your face with that same heckler when she’s been heckled in tears out of that press conference, why would labor MPs, female MPs need bodyguards at labor press conferences.
Corbyn: I have had many conversations with Ruth Smeeth since then,  I have known her concerns for many years, and I left a meeting as you would somebody you’d known and you don’t know what was said between us.
Question: Under your leadership labour has become the second political party after the BNP to be investigated by the equality and human rights commission, how do you feel to be in that kind of company.
Corbyn: It is our process that is being looked at and I’m very happy about that, we have made ourselves completely open to it, we’re the party that after all set up the equality and human rights commission and in government we will fund it properly and I think its right that our processes should be examined we are the only party that has a full processes to deal with abuse, racism of any form within our party or society is simply not acceptable we have suspended and expelled members that have been guilty of any racist activity.

Question: Jeremy Corbyn you’ve talked about standing by human rights and so on but recently you took a stand alongside Evo Morales who recently resigned and left Bolivia to Mexico, there’s protests in Bolivia that have turned violent in support of Evo Morales including food blockades that are starving cities like La Paz so how are you how you supporting human rights in that regard when you’re standing with somebody who protests and that uses such violent means .
Corbyn: I met Evo Morales in Mexico last year I had a very long conversation with him about his country and about the economic development that’s happened and the numbers of people that have been taken out of poverty. Obviously, I follow what’s going on in that country as I do in many countries in the world. He resigned from the presidency and now his moved out of Bolivia. I ask and to support other Latin American governments that asked for a process of peace in Bolivia so that the constitutions can be restored so that democratic government can come back that’s surely what is the right thing  to do.
Question: I agree but that’s not what you said in Twitter. You said you stand by Evo Morales you took a position in something in such it is a dispute right now a civil unrest that any opinion one way or another is turning violent so when you take a position
Corbyn: Of course it is obvious there is civil unrest in Bolivia there are very strong feelings on both sides about people that they feel they’ve been let down because Evo Morakes is no longer president and others that probably don’t support him at all. Surely the function now is to try and bring people together. I met Evo Morales last year. I didn’t know him over the years and I recognized that Bolivia before he became president was probably the poorest country in Latin America, it isn’t now.
Question: Mr. Corbyn will you campaign to remain or leave the EU if elected why would anyone vote labor without knowing the answer to that question.
Corbyn: Thanks for your question the issue of Brexit can be one that divides people enormously and it has and it does our whole strategy my whole strategy has been to try to bring people together however they voted in the referendum in 2016.
Question: But the question is when you campaign to remain or leave the EU if elected.
Corbyn: Can I answer it, one we will negotiate a credible deal to leave the European Union, secondly we will put that alongside remain in a referendum my role and the role of our government will be to ensure that the referendum is held in a fair atmosphere and we will abide by the result of it and I will adopt as Prime Minister of Home at the time a neutral stance so that I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring our communities and country together rather than continuing an endless debate about the EU and Brexit this will be a trade deal with Europe or remaining in the EU that will be the choice that we put before the British people within six months any other option will require years of negotiations either with the EU or the USA and put our public services at risk.

Q: We've already have three and a half years of people and the British people vote in 2016 so I don't need to vote again.
Corbyn: Well I think the demands of people to try to a some parties want to revoke article 50 I actually voted to implement article 50 some people wanted a second referendum some people wanted leaving without any deal whatsoever which I think would be catastrophic to our economy people voted remain they voted leave but they didn't vote to lose their but they didn't vote to lose their jobs they didn't vote for deregulation they didn't vote for damage to our economy and I think it's only sensible and reasonable to put that option back there to the people within six months in order to bring our country and society together to face the future together to bring about a fairer Britain 
Q: I mean this this thing about saying that oh it's you know lots of people groaning because he's saying he's not going to take a clear position there is actually precedent for now when there was a  referendum on Europe in the 1970s Howard remained neutral okay so for people to say oh this is ridiculous that you not taking position it's false it's a false position and actually the Liberal Democrats are saying reverse brexit stock brexit Boris Johnson is saying get brexit done the only person that actually has a clear strategy a grown up sensible strategy is this man right here Jeremy Corbyn. 
Q: Mr. Corbyn I appreciate your efforts at bringing people together in this country I understand your strategy I what I'm really interested in is that the Labour Party seems to be the only party which is developing a credible set of policies to deal with climate emergency could you enlighten us about what you think your Labour Party what you think your Labour Party policies would do for jobs and for a good future for young people in Sheffield.
Corbyn: Thank you thank you very much for your question we face a climate emergency across the whole world it's very obvious unusual and extreme weather patterns have got worse and worse the poorest and most vulnerable people in the poorest and most vulnerable places suffer first others suffer later we signed up to the Paris climate change Accords in 2015 I was there I thought it was great but it didn't go far enough and it's got to go didn't go far enough and it's got to go much further. So on May the first this year I proposed to parliament that we declare a climate emergency in our country and that's now been replicated in many Parliament's around the world and I'm pleased about that but it does mean we've got to play our part by reducing emissions to get to net zero emissions it also means the possibilities of a huge number of jobs and development in our country but in jobs in retrofitting houses to make them environmentally sustainable to make them better insulated to use less energy it means green energy jobs wind wave solar it means big projects like Swansea Bay Lagoon it also means a lot has to be done in protecting our diverse biodiversity our seas and our rivers and so our whole strategy is to develop a green industrial revolution which will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the future starting very very quickly and we will be therefore playing our part in getting to a more sustainable world and a Labour government on the international stage will be working with others to get to Net Zero and make sure that by our trading policies we don't end up inadvertently exporting pollution by having strong controls here but not insisting on equally strong controls somewhere else. I’m very excited by everything that's in our green industrial revolution strategy just as much as I admire those in the USA with the green new deal that they're putting forward.
Q: I noticed in your opening speech that you mentioned about broadband again at a time when they're near Chester's desperately in need of funding and there's not an everlasting pot of money why do you think that's a good use of taxpayers money.

Q: How do we know the deal you’re going to get is going to be any better or even worse than what’s already on offer and therefore are we being offered something that's not worth being… its really not credible. 

Q: Are you seriously saying though should you be in government you would come back with the New Deal it may be better than the Conservative and then not be and then not campaign either way open to the referendum the Labour Party wouldn't campaign so well we know some members of the labor force some members of your cabinet would absolutely campaign for remaining they've made it very clear.

Corbyn:  Okay can I deal with the broadband question first thank you thank you for it the first thank you thank you for it the issue is as I said earlier in 95 percent of people in South Korea have access to broadband free we have in this country 10% access and it costs people roughly 30 pounds a month and it's quite selective, the point is that by investing in it it actually promotes economic growth and brings about a degree of social justice listen everyone in this room probably has a computer and uses access to broadband if they've got it or some form of internet all the time it is the normal form of communication yet there is a big digital divide between those that can afford the best and those that don't get any whatsoever I just want to make sure it's equally available for all and over 10 years we would make sure it is and I think that's actually a sensible up-to-date modern way of looking at communications within our society so the question is can we afford it yes we can't afford it because if we don't afford it then what's the effect on areas that don't have access to broadband on their economic development on the investments that might come there on the businesses that might come there on the businesses that won't go there listen talk to a business about investing in say Cumbria or say parts of Northumbria saying would you open a factory or a shop or a small business here they'd say no there's no broadband there isn't good train train access there isn't good bus access or whatever else we have to invest in social infrastructure and transport infrastructure for the whole country otherwise the north/south divide the inequalities between regions in England and between Scotland and Wales in and between Scotland and Wales in England will simply get worse as a result of it this is a serious proposal in order to help bring economic development to all parts of our country.

Q: Then what do you make of the comments made by the institute of Fiscal Studies today that in order to pay for the broadband and all the other things that you're suggesting well you still what they're saying is you can't do that by pretending that you're just gonna text the very rich the top 5% you're going to have tax an awful lot more awful lot more of our audience.


C: I read the IFS comments very carefully obviously and we have here the gray book that we put forward which actually funds and costs the whole of our program and manifesto and I was absolutely insistent that we as a party going into election put that forward that's only right that people should understand it is 95 percent the population will pay no more whatsoever in tax the top 5% will pay a bit more corporation tax will go up to a maximum of 26 percent which is lower than it was in 2010 and lower than many countries in other parts of the world including major industrial economies and we will then move into a situation where we become more or less mid-ranking in terms of provisions of funding of public services will still be way below all the Scandinavian countries France and Germany what's happened in this country for too long is we've rolled back the public realm we've rolled back on public services and loaded that problem onto individuals families and they're often paying with it through personal debt I think we need to rebalance a bit and start investing in people communities as a whole and that's what our manifesto does.

Q: Hi I work for a charity that delivers Digital Inclusion and it's not just about broadband it's more than that giving broadband to house those is great but what are we going to do to make sure that we close the gap people can use Facebook people can use certain websites but there's other things they can't do they can't navigate public service websites NHS advice how are you going to ensure that people get that as well as broadband access

Corbyn: Well if they got good quality broadband obviously that's a start and clearly there has to be full accessibility to public services online because there is you're quite correct a digital divide where public service is increasing the doctor's appointments everything else are done online and there are a significant number of people in the country that don't necessarily have smartphones probably don't have computers and can't access those things and that becomes a form of social exclusion so I would always make it a requirement that public services must be available also in the more traditional ways as well so that nobody is left out but there's nothing worse than people that are told for example to go on to go online to sort out the universal credit can't get online because they haven’t got a computer or a smartphone how on earth are they supposed to access universal credit in that sense that's why we will end universal credit and bring back a serious system

Q: One thing I want to ask right you’re talking about delaying the Scottish independence referendum in Boise Johnson is talking about refusing it is the UK like the Hotel California you can check out anytime you want you can never leave and the last thing a what gives Westminster, the last debate, it was two Westminster MPs telling Scotland what they are not getting, surely start listening to the Scottish People and let us have a vote.

Q: Jeremy Scotland voted overwhelmingly against leaving Europe and fought pro-independence pro-independence government why will Labor not support us in deciding our own future.

C: thanks for your questions and thanks for the way that you've put them an incoming Labour government will invest a great deal across the UK including a hundred billion pounds will go into Scotland over ten years that will be a massive game-changer in Scotland where you have the worst levels of poverty and health inequality in Glasgow you have serious levels of child poverty and housing stress you know that as well as I do. I’d have said that I don't see a priority in Scotland's of having an independence referendum what I see as a priority is investing in the social and capital needs of Scotland and so in the early years of a Labour government we will not be supporting an independence referendum instead we'll be investing in Scotland and working with whoever the government is in Scotland to deliver that program deliver that improvement in in business infrastructure in transport infrastructure and in the social needs of the people of Scotland 

Q: So just so we're clear what does the early years mean is that year two year three years fours.

C: Early years first two years at least so not in the first two years I want to do I want to deliver I want to deliver a capital investment program for the whole of it and that will be our focus and so it will not be in the early part of the of the new part so not in the first two years so certainly not 2020

Q: So what gives it your right to be your priority if it's a priority of the Scottish people

C: there are factions in Scotland in 2021 and obviously the expression will come from that it is I think our right as a party to put forward a program for the whole of the UK and that is what we're doing an investment strategy for the whole of the UK and point out I point out that Scotland will get a hundred billion of investment under a Labour government which will make a very significant difference to the lives of people all across Scotland that I'm sure is something you would welcome.

Q: There’s already a mandate from Scottish people to have another referendum well there is actually there is a mandate from last year Scottish parliamentary elections and the Scottish people have voted for that mandate.
C: We are putting forward a proposal which I think will be very beneficial to all parts of the UK including Scotland and I think you have to look at the situation of the income and expenditure levels as they affect Scotland surely Scotland needs to be able to address the problems it has and the Industrial and green infrastructure investment that he absolutely needs.

Q: What you're saying is promising things for Scotland to try and  avoid on it another independence referendum it's very similar to what promises made by senior labor members with the…okay how can trust that this would not be an old piece of broken promises

C: Since 2014 there has been a Tory government in the UK and that’s one of the problems.

Q: Have you finally got an opportunity after nine years of the Tories to get rid of the legacy of Thatcher and Blair and the market and the things that are in your manifesto that improved people's lives the first question was about being frightened I'm not frightened I'm only frightened when I see people on the streets when I see people can't get health care all those things are you finding the position you win and you can put it right.

Q: When you say that you’re not going to increase taxation but I’ve read today in your manifesto it states that you’re going to abolish the married person's tax for couples on a lower type of combined income I mean how can that be fair I mean in the last year it cost something like 480 million pounds and what else you're planning on spending.

C: First of all we are not doing any deals with any other parties I’m not trying to form a coalition government I'm fighting this election to win it for labour to win it for the people of this country to end universal credit deal with the issues of inequality injustice and poverty and deliver an economy that absolutely works for all and our taxation proposals will affect the richest 5% of the people in this country we will end the marriage tax allowance because I think it's discriminatory against non married couples and they ought to be treated equally across the society an individual taxation is a fairer way of doing things my manifesto fully prepared fully costed I think this is an opportunity for our country to come together deal with the inequality injustice in poverty I can actually go forward to the future with some degree of hope
 



Boris Johnson

Q: I would just like to ask you how important it is for you to always tell the truth?

BJ: I think it is vital and I think that the issue of trust in politics is central to this election and fundamental to the corrosion of trust in politics at the moment you're being asked that question let's be clear is the failure of politicians to deliver Brexit. 

Q: Just a minute Prime Minister, is that what you meant? I’m speaking about the WASPIs do you know the WASPIs? You made statements that you would help and you would take that forward and are you still in that frame of mind that you’re going to help us out, you are going to sort out this pension issue?

JB:  well the waspey issue as everybody knows is a very difficult problem caused by a change in the in the pension age for women who retired of a certain age and I do I do sympathize deeply with the looked at it and looked at it and I would love to be able to magic you a solution it is it is very expensive to come up with the solution that you want and I'm gonna be I'm gonna be honest with you tonight I cannot promise that I can magic up that money for you tonight. It is not possible to satisfy all the demands of the WASPI women, I am gonna put my hands up and confess that.

Q: I think it's the most important point of this general election why are you refusing to release the report on Russian interference in British politics. Why should you be prime minister if you constantly keep on avoiding scrutiny, you cancelled parliament for five weeks, you banned the daily mirror from the Conservative bus. You keep saying Leave is good for the people but I don’t think I've ever heard you address specific issues bringing into question the validity of the referendum so for example we know that the leave campaign broke electoral spending rules and privacy laws we know that many people voted to leave based on wrong information including what was written on the side of a bus we know that leave was not defined and still isn't actually agreed upon today and I'd love for you to address these issues and also actually talk about why you think you've got a mandate to go through with Brexit that this general election can be your mandate when Brexit is mixed in with health care and climate change and education.

JB: Why are we having this election why my one allegedly avoiding the screening why well here I am and very happy to be to be scrutinized but on your on your point about the the reasons for having the election let's be in no doubt I didn't want to have an election now and no Prime Minister wants an election on December the 12th we have to do it because Parliament is blocking brexit and I’m afraid.

Q: That’s not quite right – parliament accepted a reading of your bill they then didn’t want to do it in just three days.

JB: Well they were given every opportunity to pass it pass it and they passed a law to insist that we extended beyond October the 31st and what we have now is a situation in which the other three party leaders either want to block brexit or absurdly want to have a second referendum on the EU and I think that’s Mr. Corbyn’s position, it seems to have mutated tonight he now is going to be neutral on the deal he proposes to do, I don’t see how he’s going to do a deal and be neutral or indifferent to the deal that wants to do never mind that I do not think whatever deal mr. Corbyn proposes I don’t think its sensible for this great country of ours to spend next year in yet more delectable disputations about the EU and and and then another referendum if I understood correctly what happened earlier on another referendum on Scotland how can that be right for our country I want next year to be a fantastic year for our country where a very ambitious one nation Conservative government we have amazing plans for this country investing in education investing in health and that's what we want to get on with it we need to get brexit done to do it 

Q: Mr. Johnson while its clear the economy is doing really well how can you justify for example in my commitment in my constituency where I work as a senior leader in a secondary school how can you justify that 40% of the children in my community are living in poverty and nationally many many poor more people nationally many many poor more people are homeless and many people who are working perhaps on 40 hour contracts a week are having to use food banks so how can you justify this

JB: You’re from nearby yeah but listen look I I want you to know that I've been in office for about 120 days or so as Prime Minister and I do understand and I've been to many hospitals many schools in the time that I've been promised and I've talked to nurses and doctors and teachers about what's going on in their school and that's why were now leveling up funding for education across this country putting more money into both primary and secondary schools and I want to see that going directly to your school

Q: You say you’ve been Prime Minister for about 120 days which of course is true but the Conservatives have been in power for 9 years.

BJ: Yes absolutely and that’s a fair point, Fiona, but I would point out to you through most that time I was actually I was I was running London and when I was running London we reduced the gap between we reduced the gap between rich and poor and we did it and one of the things I did which which we've now brought into government we introduced the living wage will massively expanded the living wage when I was mayor of London that became a national policy George Osborne nicked it from us act of theft I was perfectly happy to to condone and it's become a national policy and I'm proud to say that under us conservatives were going we're going to raise the living wage to its highest 
ever level and I guess if you want to me to raise the living wage to its highest ever level and I guess if you want to me do I want to to tackle poverty in area yes I certainly do and yes I certainly want to give every kid in the country the opportunities to make the most of their talents and that is what I believe in passionately as a conservative I want to see equality of opportunity in this country I believe I believe that you have you have talent genius ability uniformly distributed throughout the whole of the UK

Q:mr. Johnson I'd like to say whilst you're in South Yorkshire I hope you manage to say dry like unlike a lot of the resident in the past month yeah talking about flooding as a working single mother I rely on benefits to get by and just about managed to sustain myself and my two	children under the Conservative government what guarantee do I have of staying on this side of the food banks				
				
BJ: well first of all I'm about the flooding and I very very determined to make sure everybody whose lives have been affected by flooding gets the compensation and the help that they need in your Fela our announcement that every home is going to get every damaged home is going to get at least five thousand pounds to to help them with the with  repairs and in addition to what we're doing to help with council tax and and other things we will also help with with
it with insurance but but on your your basic question about tackling poverty of course we want to deal with not just the
the expression of poverty but also with the causes of poverty and that means dealing with educational standards I
mean it means it means spreading ambition and hope around the country by investing in education investing in social services adult and child social services as we are now also and so just a question of the living wage it's also a question of helping people with the
cost of living and that's why we're cutting national insurance contributions and are trying to put more doing things
tohelp people with the cost of their heating they've got their fuel bills and putting more money into people's pockets
every year we want to help people with the cost of living because the gap between rich and poor has actually diminished

Q: How much is cutting the national insurance going to save people every week.

BJ: it's not it's not a huge so it's only a hundred pounds a year to begin with that a pounds a year but it's
five hundred pounds a year it's five hundred pounds a year once we've got to our ambition of twelve thousand a
threshold of twelve hundred of twelve thousand five hundred and I want I want to do more

Q: you're promising that yeah I'm to work I'm yet to be moved on to universal credit how does that work I'm gonna lose money and yet you're promising more relief in other areas it doesn't make sense

BJ: well I mean I said I'm very sandy but I'm very happy to talk afterwards about what we can do to help your specific case but I do
think that I do think the universal I know that some people want to describe Universal Credit without putting
anything in its place it has worked in the sense that it has helped many to a couple of hundred thousand people at
least in to work and one of the features of the economy at the moment whatever the problems we have is that we have
more people in employment than ever before we have more women in the workforce than ever before and actually
and actually incomes are starting to grow faster than any time in the last 12 years so so and that is what we want to focus on

Q: hello mr. Johnson my name is Dylan on the student at the University of Manchester and I just want to ask you
why should a young person between 18 and 25 years old vote for the Conservative Party without using campaign rhetoric just straight answer please

BJ: I believe that we are the party that is going to do the most to help you to get a fantastic high-wage
high-skilled job we're about graduate and help you and help you to get a home by building record numbers of homes help
you to get help you to get onto the onto the housing ladder that's it and helping it and we have built and great respect
sir we've built a record number last year and and we have a plan to build more

Q: think it's so much groaning it I assume you're thinking of that the conservative pledge to build 200,000 starter homes in 2014 and none of those have been built

BJ: well actually if you look if you look at what we've done just last year we built 240,000 homes which was more which was more than any year for the last except in the last 31 years bar 1 and of those 57,000 we're affordable homes and you look at
my record as mayor of London we out built labor by miles when I was mayor we will
build the homes for young people growing up in this country we will also make 
sure that they have the jobs to go to and we and we will and we will and our
answer the answer if he's allowed to shout happy to answer it and we and we
will just to complete this point and we will put in the transport infrastructure
as I say and improving education the will allow us to unite and level our camp this country 
that is what I want to do

Q: When will you release the Russian report?

BJ: 
there is absolutely no evidence to show any interference in any
electoral event and the reason I won't is I see no reason or reason I decided not
to age it's guys because I see no reason to interfere with a normal time table I'm sorry to say I'm great
respect so this is compete Bermuda Triangle stuff there is no as is this as is the suggest as is the suggestion that
the referendum when seventeen point four million people voted to leave was somehow false vitiating not fair I'm
wrong and shouldn't I be cancelled I don't think that is true my strong view is that the people of this country voted
to leave they've waited three and a half years I think at least the Liberal Democrats are saying scrub the
referendum and and and so that's my impression on they saying revoke article 50 and we've had an ask that otherwise

Q: hi prime minister racist rhetoric in this country is completely rife will you admit that you have personally contributed to this
and say the words I'm sorry well I've written many millions of worlds in my life as a journalist and I've never
intended I genuinely never intended to cause hurt or pain to anybody and that that and that is that is my that is my
intention what I will say because I think you're referring to a particular article a year or so ago more than more than that well
there's a few in fairness there's a few articles so there's the Muslim women going around looking at letterbox which
was last year you referred to tribal warriors with watermelon smiles and flag wave and pickaninnies and then just to get another demographic in there, tank topped bum boys.

BJ: well you know if you if you if you go through all my articles with a
fine-tooth comb you can and take out individual phrases there is no doubt that you can find things that can be made to seem offensive and of course and
I understand that I understand that but what I will say just don't just on the in just on that on the the point of that
I think the lady was afraid olive was olive was referring to I defend my right to to speak out and I defend I do defend
my right to and if you actually read the piece which I don't know how many people have if you read the piece what I was
really doing I suggest you read any of them all of them what I was really what I was really doing was mounting a strong
liberal defense of the right of women in this country to wear what they choose and I think most people and not to be
oppressed into wearing something they don't want to wear and I think most people in this country would agree with
that

Q: So Olive is asking if you will say you are sorry.

BJ: 
you know I've just got to get back to my my fundamental point I think that I've I've always stood up for the gender equality I campaigned I
if you look at the way I ran city hall I campaigned I had a roughly half and half male/female team the number one campaign
I ran as as Foreign Secretary was for twelve years of quality education for every girl in the world which by the way
is the single best and most beautiful thing we could do to solve the problems of this planet and the UK is leading on
it and I'm very proud as a former foreign secretary to have to have champion

Q: My questions about the NHS but I just like to back up on this point you just talked about defending the freedoms of women
and you don't do that by taking down a religious minority you don't do that by offending Muslim women that's not how
you sure we may come to that let me just stay on the subject for a moment if that's okay well I'm gonna come here
the way that you've spoken about Muslim women in particular and the way that you've spoken about race in the past is
completely characteristic of the way your government has dealt with all the issues that's come up across since 2010
it's been characterized by complete carelessness by callousness the way you treat people through the DWP where
you've treated the victims of rain fell the hostile environment it's like it's completely well you say you visited
hospitals and you've spoken to public service workers but I think you yourself know you haven't been welcomed when
you've been to speak to them the way you've conducted yourself when you've been there is shown that you're afraid
of the response you're going to get so I think it's I think it's insulting to the people who've suffered under your
government even if you say you've only been you know in power for a hundred days you've been part of the government
for the last nine years I think it's completely insulting for you for you to stand there and talk about all the
investment you're going to bring when it's your austerity policies that have brought

BJ: well you know just all I can all I can say to you is to repeat my what I've
said actually in this party in the Conservative Party unlike other parties we have zero tolerance of Islamophobia
when we do we and people are asked to stand down if they're guilty of Islamophobia or or any other prejudice
or any other hate speech and and and that is what we that's what we do and I'm delighted I'm and we are gonna have
an inquiry into prejudice of all kind so anticipate the questions you're not having an inquiry and exploratory into
Islamophobia as you as you promised on television and let me and yes we are we're having an inquiry into all and
Islamophobia and all types of prejudice in the Conservative Party of course we will do that but I think but on the but
we'll begin by the end of this year if we're lucky enough to be returned and let me be clear let me be clear that I'm
proud of the record of the Conservative Party in promoting women to them which party has produced two male to female
Prime Minister's ours it's a it's a fair what we have large numbers of women in the cabinet today I'm delighted to say
and we have a large very large and growing number we have we have at least 35 percent of our candidates at this
election are our female and I'm delighted by our record yes of course there is more they're looking but I'm
with the Conservatives under the Conservatives the gender pay gap has shrunk and and we are doing everything
we can to to help women into the workforce not least through childcare policies some which I announced today

Q: 
good evening prime minister I am in 2015 the Tory government pledged to recruit
and to train an additional five thousand GPs by 2020 in 2019 there are actually
fewer GPS why on earth should I now believe yet another pledge that you will
recruit an additional six thousand GPS over the course of the next parliament

BJ: 
well Richard I think it to the best of my knowledge we have five thousand and
more doctors I appreciate it's not saying the GP 5,000 more doctors this
year than the last year we are making progress

Q: but his point is that the pledges have been made before and have have not been delivered so why should you believe
your pledge at this time

BJ: 
because we are look at what we've done already with mercy there are 17,000 more nurses now
than there were in 2010 and yes look if you if you want my view on this yes of course I want more GPs and of course I want more investment in
the NHS and we're putting in now the biggest ever cash boost into the NHS under this one nation Conservative
government and and we and we will get more GPS 54 million GP appointment more GP appointments between now and 2025
where we will do that because we are putting the sun's and it's not just that we're building new hospitals were
investing in people as well where do you want the answer and the answer is that were we're upgrading 20 and as a result
of the decision the result of the decisions that we have taken 40 in 10 years time 14 new hospitals will have
been built and yes we're starting yes starting with six but there are 14 no it's building six new ones immediately but a program
over the next 10 years with seed funding already going in to build 40

Q: with respect we do need a lot of extra cash in the NHS and it's through years of underinvestment that we're actually in a
position that were able I agree with that thank you let's say I do it it's more about thecondition it's as much about the
conditions as it is about the money yeah and you know morale in the NHS is on its knees but the workload is going through
the roof we can't keep the GPS that are close to retirement from retiring because they just see this in they think I want out
when we're trying to train new GPS to come into the service they see all of this and they think do I want to stay in
England we've invested hundreds of thousands of pounds in their training and they look and think do I want to
commit the next 40 years of my career here or am I gonna go to Australia New Zealand Canada and they they go there
they work 40 hours instead of six-hour at 60 hour weeks they get better pay they don't have a political football
they don't they don't get treated like a political or we need to look at the conditions as well as the money that's
been invested

BJ: I appreciate massively the work that all the staff doing the in the NHS and I I have to say I think your point is
right and many doctors many senior doctors have made the point to me in particular about their their pension
arrangements and where we're trying to address that we just taken further steps to address that this year and III know
that the the problem that the doctors face but we're also recruiting huge numbers I just say sincerely to people
the only way we can do this is by having a strong economy and I'm afraid to say and and that is throughout the economy
has grown every year for the last nine years it's now 20 percent bigger than it was and when Labour left office last
time as with every departing Labor government they left and economic shambles and if you look at what is being prepared what was proposed
yesterday not only is very a vast hole in the heart of it in the sense we don't know what their brexit policy is but
their economic plans for this country

Q: I'm a physiotherapist and the problem is across the board in theNHS parts of problem was getting rid of
the NHS bursaries which starts a lot of mature students coming back I would have been able to train without
that bursary and you've shot a lot of people out with that so would you reverse that decision to help get people
back in okay let's take a couple I'm a junior doctor in A&E in the NHS and overthe past nine years since you've been in
power I've seen that waiting lists are getting longer people in trollese for hours and hours in A&E and it's not just
inconvenient people are dying and I think you're lying to us every year you tell it you promise more money for the
NHS but the reality is people and people in the NHS people who work there and who use it know that that money isn't
getting through why should we trust that you're going to get this twenty six billion for the NHS when you've got
years of cuts and people are dying big part of the election process is all about they trust that you want us to put
in to you and even in this sort of campaign over the last week we've seen twitter handles that have been changed by
the Conservatives we've seen URLs that have been bought purporting to be from labour things and you're asking us to
put our trust in big decisions but yet even simple things you can't seem to get that right so why on earth should we
trust you with anything else

BJ: 
I mean let's get back to this this this central issue look at what I said I would do but I set out to be Mayor of London ten years ago are we having questions about whether I can I can
deliver we massively cut crime I promise to admit cut crime and we did we had a huge investment very substantially than
50% cut in the murder rate we massively invested in transporting the cut delays on the tube by 30% we out built the
Labour Party when it came to housing i over delivered on my promises when you look at what what I promised on the
steps of Downing Street a few months ago three or so months ago I promised we put 20,000 more police on the streets of our
country there they're coming there I've talked I've talked to them they are being recruited now I said I said that
we would put the biggest ever cash boost into the NHS and it is happening and we're doing as I say 20 hospital
upgrades and 40 new hospital and to get to all and all the points that are being raised yes of course I understand that
things have been tough in the NHS and I understand the pressures that the NHS is under but as I say I've talked to
hundreds of doctors and nurses in the last few months I know the massive massive demand that the NHS faces but we
can only meet that demand we can only meet that demand if we have a dynamic economy and I'm afraid we won't get this
economy really moving again we won't get the investment coming in and you know what I'm going to say until we get it's
true it happens to be true until we get brexit done and at the moment that is hanging over us it's paralyzing Parliament and to get back to your trust
point that is in my view the single biggest corrosion of trust in politics people voted three and a half years ago
Oh party every other part every other party that you've had on tonight is basically trying to frustrate that
outcome we have a deal and it's a good deal it will allow us it's a it's a great deal it's there it's ready to go
it will enable us it will enable us to have 20/20 not as a year to mine but 20/20 as a year of clarity and growth
thank that's what I will oversee
