42,let's have our first question from Ian,115,7.289,8cQMzVjHBeI
43,Parkin good evening Jeremy should,117.819,6.601,8cQMzVjHBeI
44,businesses be frightened of an incoming,122.289,5.491,8cQMzVjHBeI
45,labour government no they should not be,124.42,4.379,8cQMzVjHBeI
46,frightened of an incoming labour,127.78,3.66,8cQMzVjHBeI
47,government because our country's economy,128.799,5.821,8cQMzVjHBeI
48,relies on many small and medium-sized,131.44,5.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
49,enterprises that are the motor of our,134.62,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
50,economy that often have great difficulty,136.72,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
51,in accessing capital and accessing,138.4,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
52,support for what they're trying to do,140.41,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
53,the biggest businesses will be asked to,141.76,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
54,pay a little bit more in corporation tax,144.34,5.399,8cQMzVjHBeI
55,but it will be lower than it was in 2010,147.01,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
56,and indeed lower than the average for,149.739,3.961,8cQMzVjHBeI
57,most industrial countries what I want to,151.09,5.1,8cQMzVjHBeI
58,do is ensure that there is an economy,153.7,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
59,thriving in every part of the country,156.19,4.199,8cQMzVjHBeI
60,and so that means the resources it means,157.93,4.32,8cQMzVjHBeI
61,an infrastructure system roads and,160.389,3.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
62,railways all across the country it means,162.25,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
63,broadband in every part of our country,164.019,4.921,8cQMzVjHBeI
64,that's free to everyone to use and that,166.15,5.19,8cQMzVjHBeI
65,will mean that businesses can set be set,168.94,6.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
66,up anywhere it also is also clear in our,171.34,5.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
67,manifesto here that what we came to do,174.97,4.019,8cQMzVjHBeI
68,is ensure there is a better trained,177.16,4.32,8cQMzVjHBeI
69,workforce in our society so we will be,178.989,4.801,8cQMzVjHBeI
70,promoting apprenticeships and skilled,181.48,4.259,8cQMzVjHBeI
71,training at every level and gives them,183.79,4.199,8cQMzVjHBeI
72,the same value as academic education in,185.739,4.891,8cQMzVjHBeI
73,universities and so I enjoy working with,187.989,4.801,8cQMzVjHBeI
74,all the business organizations setting,190.63,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
75,out clearly our views on public,192.79,4.259,8cQMzVjHBeI

80,it's businesses who should be scared,206.91,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
81,just I think it's everyone you're,208.59,5.37,8cQMzVjHBeI
82,reckless socialist ideas are genuinely,210.6,5.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
83,terrifying to me my family and my,213.96,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
84,friends and I think freedom will,216.45,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
85,completely erode if we let you have the,218.01,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
86,keys number 10 okay before you answer,220.2,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
87,mr. Corben can I hear from you as well,222.3,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
88,please so what about the businesses that,223.74,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
89,you're going to nationalize that then,225.78,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
90,warmth exists so when you're saying,227.19,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
91,about free internet and your likes a,229.08,3.03,8cQMzVjHBeI

94,on rights and freedoms in our society,237.51,5.82,8cQMzVjHBeI

96,speech I supported the introduction of,243.33,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
97,the Human Rights Act I support the,245.97,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
98,Convention on Human Rights freedoms and,247.53,4.77,8cQMzVjHBeI
99,rights in a democracy are very very,249.87,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
100,important I spent my life getting into,252.3,4.77,8cQMzVjHBeI
101,hot water for defending people because I,254.43,4.649,8cQMzVjHBeI
102,believe their human rights should not be,257.07,3.449,8cQMzVjHBeI
103,violated and that's the kind of,259.079,3.541,8cQMzVjHBeI
104,government that I intend to lead that it,260.519,3.781,8cQMzVjHBeI
105,does guarantee democracy so why do you,262.62,2.94,8cQMzVjHBeI

107,being in power well I can't understand,265.56,5.94,8cQMzVjHBeI

110,maybe would maybe we can talk about it I,273.44,12.13,8cQMzVjHBeI
111,live in a society where we do deal with,281.87,6.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
112,the worst aspects of poverty that exist,285.57,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
113,in our society we do invest properly in,287.91,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
114,our schools we do give all our children,290.04,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
115,a real chance and we do have a health,291.93,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
116,service that is really there for all of,293.85,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
117,us all times that's the kind of agenda,295.74,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
118,that I've spent my life dealing was the,298.08,3.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
119,gentleman that asked the question about,299.79,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
120,businesses on the questions of public,301.37,4.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
121,ownership which are quite right to raise,304.32,4.44,8cQMzVjHBeI
122,our proposals are that we will take our,305.76,5.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
123,railways which after all were invested,308.76,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
124,in and built by the rest of us back into,311.19,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
125,public ownership will take Royal Mail,312.66,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
126,back into public ownership as it's a,314.76,4.409,8cQMzVjHBeI
127,natural monopoly and our water industry,317.04,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
128,which has been assets stripped to within,319.169,4.351,8cQMzVjHBeI
129,in each of its life though many of these,321.96,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
130,water companies and wastes a great deal,323.52,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
131,of water will come back into public,325.89,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
132,ownership which will be run with,327.69,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI

134,announcement we made last week was on,331.95,5.1,8cQMzVjHBeI
135,broadband because I believe that,334.26,4.379,8cQMzVjHBeI
136,the government's proposals are,337.05,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
137,insufficient only 10% of households in,338.639,5.041,8cQMzVjHBeI

219,any form within our party or our society,522.31,5.97,8cQMzVjHBeI
220,is simply not acceptable we have,526.18,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
221,suspended and expelled members that have,528.28,4.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
222,been guilty of any racist activity when,530.23,10.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
223,I hear you talk about standing by human,533.23,9.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
224,rights and so on but recently it took a,540.49,4.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
225,stands alongside Evo Morales who,542.83,4.98,8cQMzVjHBeI
226,recently resigned and left Bolivia to,545.44,2.94,8cQMzVjHBeI
227,Mexico,547.81,2.19,8cQMzVjHBeI
228,there's protests in Bolivia that I've,548.38,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
229,turned violent in support of Evo Morales,550,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
230,including food blockades that are,552.58,5.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
231,starving cities like La Paz so how are,554.92,4.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
232,you how are you supporting human rights,558.31,2.67,8cQMzVjHBeI
233,in that regard when you're standing with,559.72,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
234,somebody who has protests that support,560.98,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
235,in that use such violent means to the,562.93,6.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
236,user I met Evo Morales in Mexico last,564.28,6.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
237,year I had a very long conversation with,569.08,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
238,him about his country and about the,571.06,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
239,economic development that's happened and,573.28,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
240,the numbers of people have been taken,574.99,2.67,8cQMzVjHBeI
241,out of poverty,576.73,3.09,8cQMzVjHBeI
242,obviously I follow what's going on in,577.66,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
243,that country as I do in many other,579.82,4.019,8cQMzVjHBeI
244,countries in the world he resigned from,581.65,5.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
245,the presidency and now his move,583.839,6.101,8cQMzVjHBeI
246,out of Bolivia I ask and to support the,586.76,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
247,other Latin American governments that,589.94,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
248,asked for a process of peace in Bolivia,591.35,5.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
249,so that the Constitution can be restored,594.41,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
250,so that democratic government can come,596.87,4.019,8cQMzVjHBeI
251,back but that's not what surely is the,599,3.839,8cQMzVjHBeI
252,right thing to do I agree but that's not,600.889,3.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
253,what you said in Twitter you said you,602.839,2.911,8cQMzVjHBeI

255,in something in such a is a a dispute,605.75,6.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
256,right now a civil unrest that any,610.13,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
257,opinion one way or another is turning,612.38,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
258,violent so when you take a position in,614.54,3.419,8cQMzVjHBeI
259,some there is of course there are,616.37,3.269,8cQMzVjHBeI
260,involved it's obvious there is it's,617.959,3.541,8cQMzVjHBeI
261,obvious there is civil unrest in Bolivia,619.639,3.271,8cQMzVjHBeI
262,there are very strong feelings on both,621.5,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
263,sides about people that feel they've,622.91,5.34,8cQMzVjHBeI
264,been let down because every Morales is,625.22,5.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
265,no longer president others that probably,628.25,4.649,8cQMzVjHBeI
266,don't support him at all surely the,630.44,4.139,8cQMzVjHBeI
267,function now is to try and bring people,632.899,2.101,8cQMzVjHBeI

273,the poorest country in Latin America it,643.31,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
274,isn't now okay I'm sorry that you don't,645.199,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI

281,labor without knowing the answer to that,658.22,3.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
282,question,659.75,2.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
283,thanks for your question the issue of,665,5.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
284,brexit can be one that divides people,668.36,6.029,8cQMzVjHBeI
285,enormously and it has and it does our,670.85,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
286,whole strategy my whole strategy has,674.389,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
287,been to try to bring people together,676.1,3.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
288,however they voted in the referendum in,678.199,3.931,8cQMzVjHBeI
289,2016 but the question is when your,680.05,3.64,8cQMzVjHBeI
290,campaign to remain or leave the EU if,682.13,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI

293,negotiate a credible leave deal with the,690.529,3.961,8cQMzVjHBeI
294,European you let me finish please I've,692.66,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI

296,question secondly we will put that,696.11,5.94,8cQMzVjHBeI
297,alongside remain in a referendum my role,698.69,5.16,8cQMzVjHBeI
298,and the role of our government will be,702.05,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
299,to ensure that that referendum is held,703.85,4.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
300,in a fair atmosphere and we will abide,705.92,6.479,8cQMzVjHBeI
301,by the result of it and I will adopt as,708.8,5.159,8cQMzVjHBeI
302,Prime Minister of Home at the time a,712.399,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
303,neutral stance so that I can credibly,713.959,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
304,carry out the results of that to bring,716.149,4.261,8cQMzVjHBeI
305,our communities and country together,718.519,4.891,8cQMzVjHBeI
306,rather than continuing an endless debate,720.41,6.239,8cQMzVjHBeI
307,about the EU and brexit this will be a,723.41,5.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
308,trade deal with Europe or remaining in,726.649,4.44,8cQMzVjHBeI
309,the EU that will be the choice that we,729.23,3.719,8cQMzVjHBeI
310,put before the British people within six,731.089,3.661,8cQMzVjHBeI
311,months any other option will require,732.949,4.351,8cQMzVjHBeI
312,years of negotiations either with the EU,734.75,4.829,8cQMzVjHBeI
313,or the USA and put our public services,737.3,4.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
314,at risk Daniel,739.579,7.281,8cQMzVjHBeI
315,[Applause],741.33,7.34,8cQMzVjHBeI
316,we've already have three and a half,746.86,3.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
317,years of people and the British people,748.67,3.359,8cQMzVjHBeI
318,vote in 2016 so I don't need to vote,750.29,5.279,8cQMzVjHBeI
319,again well I think the demands of people,752.029,7.321,8cQMzVjHBeI
320,to try to a some parties want to revoke,755.569,5.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
321,article 50 I actually voted to implement,759.35,5.13,8cQMzVjHBeI
322,article 50 some people wanted a second,761.389,5.49,8cQMzVjHBeI
323,referendum some people wanted leaving,764.48,4.469,8cQMzVjHBeI
324,without any deal whatsoever which I,766.879,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
325,think would be catastrophic to our,768.949,3.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
326,economy people voted remain they voted,770.239,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
327,leave but they didn't vote to lose their,772.549,2.97,8cQMzVjHBeI
328,jobs they didn't vote for deregulation,773.989,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
329,they didn't vote for damage to our,775.519,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
330,economy and I think it's only sensible,777.679,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
331,and reasonable to put that option back,779.779,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
332,there to the people within six months in,782.179,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
333,order to bring our country and society,784.129,5.041,8cQMzVjHBeI
334,together to face the future together to,786.199,12.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
335,bring about a fairer Britain I mean this,789.17,11.909,8cQMzVjHBeI
336,this thing about saying that oh it's you,798.949,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
337,know lots of people groaning because,801.079,2.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
338,he's saying he's not going to take a,802.369,2.551,8cQMzVjHBeI
339,clear position there is actually,803.839,3.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
340,precedence for this now when there was a,804.92,5.009,8cQMzVjHBeI
341,referendum on Europe in the 1970s Howard,806.989,5.491,8cQMzVjHBeI
342,Wilson remained neutral okay so for,809.929,4.231,8cQMzVjHBeI
343,people to say oh this is ridiculous that,812.48,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
344,you not taking position it's false it's,814.16,5.119,8cQMzVjHBeI
345,a false position and actually,815.99,3.289,8cQMzVjHBeI
346,the Liberal Democrats are saying reverse,821.03,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
347,brexit stock brexit Boris Johnson is,823.73,5.49,8cQMzVjHBeI
348,saying get brexit done the only person,826.28,4.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
349,that actually has a clear strategy a,829.22,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
350,grown up sensible strategy is this man,831.08,9.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
351,right here Joe Nickell he was in favor,833.03,9.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
352,but he allowed a free vote on it yes the,840.32,7.44,8cQMzVjHBeI
353,woman there mr. Corbyn I appreciate your,842.57,8.61,8cQMzVjHBeI
354,efforts at bringing people together in,847.76,5.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
355,this country I understand your strategy,851.18,5.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
356,I what I'm really interested in is that,853.58,7.13,8cQMzVjHBeI
357,the Labour Party seems to be the only,857,7.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
358,party which is developing a credible set,860.71,6.55,8cQMzVjHBeI
359,of policies to deal with climate,864.92,7.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
360,emergency could you enlighten us about,867.26,8.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
361,what you think your Labour Party,872.66,5.7,8cQMzVjHBeI
362,policies would do for jobs and for a,875.48,5.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
363,good future for young people in,878.36,5.61,8cQMzVjHBeI
364,Sheffield thank you thank you thank you,880.66,6.07,8cQMzVjHBeI
365,very much for your question we face a,883.97,5.55,8cQMzVjHBeI
366,climate emergency across the whole world,886.73,5.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
367,it's very obvious unusual and extreme,889.52,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
368,weather patterns have got worse and,892.49,3.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
369,worse the poorest and most vulnerable,893.93,3.09,8cQMzVjHBeI
370,people in the poorest and most,895.73,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
371,vulnerable places suffer first others,897.02,5.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
372,suffer later we signed up to the Paris,899.21,6.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
373,climate change Accords in 2015 I was,902.45,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
374,there I thought it was great but it,905.27,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
375,didn't go far enough and it's got to go,907.28,3.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
376,much further so on May the first this,908.78,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
377,year I proposed to Parliament that we,911.12,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
378,declare a climate emergency in our,913.13,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
379,country and that's now been replicated,915.74,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
380,in many Parliament's around the world,917.12,4.44,8cQMzVjHBeI
381,and I'm pleased about that but it does,919.13,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
382,mean we've got to play our part by,921.56,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
383,reducing emissions to get to zero zero,923.96,4.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
384,emissions it also means the,926.27,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
385,possibilities of a huge number of jobs,928.61,5.34,8cQMzVjHBeI
386,and development in our country but in,931.28,4.559,8cQMzVjHBeI
387,dealing with this emergency it means,933.95,4.88,8cQMzVjHBeI
388,jobs in retrofitting houses to make them,935.839,5.371,8cQMzVjHBeI
389,environmentally sustainable to make them,938.83,4.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
390,better insulated to use less energy it,941.21,5.4,8cQMzVjHBeI
391,means green energy jobs wind wave solar,943.73,5.58,8cQMzVjHBeI
392,it means big projects like Swansea Bay,946.61,4.88,8cQMzVjHBeI
393,Lagoon it also means a lot,949.31,4.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
394,has to be done in protecting our diverse,951.49,4.98,8cQMzVjHBeI
395,biodiversity our seas and our rivers and,953.79,5.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
396,so our whole strategy is to develop a,956.47,4.679,8cQMzVjHBeI
397,green industrial revolution which will,958.99,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
398,create hundreds of thousands of jobs in,961.149,4.771,8cQMzVjHBeI
399,the future starting very very quickly,963.61,4.289,8cQMzVjHBeI
400,and we will be therefore playing our,965.92,4.169,8cQMzVjHBeI
401,part in getting to a more sustainable,967.899,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
402,world and a Labour government on the,970.089,3.931,8cQMzVjHBeI
403,international stage will be working with,972.459,4.021,8cQMzVjHBeI
404,others to get to Net Zero and make sure,974.02,4.379,8cQMzVjHBeI
405,that by our trading policies we don't,976.48,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
406,end up inadvertently exporting pollution,978.399,4.951,8cQMzVjHBeI
407,by having strong controls here but not,981.31,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
408,insisting on equally strong controls,983.35,3.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
409,somewhere else thank you I'm very,985.27,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
410,excited by everything that's in our,987.19,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
411,green industrial revolution strategy,989.23,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
412,just as much as I admire those in the,990.88,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
413,USA with the green new deal that they're,992.95,10.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
414,putting forward okay I noticed in your,994.6,10.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
415,opening speech that you mentioned about,1003.36,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
416,broadband again at a time when they're,1005.55,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
417,near Chester's desperately in need of,1007.62,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
418,funding and there's not an everlasting,1009.12,5.07,8cQMzVjHBeI
419,part of mone why do you think that's a,1012.51,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
420,good use of taxpayers money okay let's,1014.19,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
421,hear from the men behind you there you,1016.29,4.1,8cQMzVjHBeI
422,said about negotiating another deal,1018.48,5.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
423,after the election how do we know the,1020.39,4.449,8cQMzVjHBeI
424,deal you're going to get is going to be,1023.7,2.55,8cQMzVjHBeI
425,any better or even worse than what,1024.839,3.571,8cQMzVjHBeI
426,what's already on offer and therefore,1026.25,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
427,are we being offered something that's,1028.41,3.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
428,not worth being having breakfast in the,1029.76,4.169,8cQMzVjHBeI
429,first place so really it's not credible,1032.01,6.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
430,and the woman here in the black top are,1033.929,6.931,8cQMzVjHBeI
431,you seriously saying though should you,1038.52,3.689,8cQMzVjHBeI
432,be in government you would come back,1040.86,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
433,with the New Deal it may be better than,1042.209,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
434,the conception it may not be and then,1044.91,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
435,not campaign either way open to the,1046.589,4.351,8cQMzVjHBeI
436,referendum the Labour Party wouldn't,1048.96,4.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
437,campaign so well we know some members of,1050.94,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
438,the labor force some members of your,1053.82,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
439,cabinet would absolutely campaign for,1055.08,2.88,8cQMzVjHBeI
440,remaining they've made it very clear,1057.09,1.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
441,okay,1057.96,3.12,8cQMzVjHBeI
442,can I deal with the broadband question,1058.77,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
443,first thank you thank you for it the,1061.08,7.229,8cQMzVjHBeI
444,issue is as I said earlier in 95 percent,1063.36,6.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
445,of people in South Korea have access to,1068.309,4.291,8cQMzVjHBeI
446,broadband free we have in this country,1070.17,4.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
447,10% access and it costs people roughly,1072.6,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
448,30 pounds a month and it's quite,1074.97,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
449,selective the areas it's not free in,1076.86,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
450,South Korea there is it for some people,1078.66,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
451,it is I'm not sure about it it's not,1080.85,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
452,available for the whole country our,1082.11,3.12,8cQMzVjHBeI
453,point is that,1084.39,3.09,8cQMzVjHBeI
454,by investing in it it actually promotes,1085.23,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
455,economic growth and brings about a,1087.48,4.079,8cQMzVjHBeI
456,degree of social justice listen everyone,1089.16,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
457,in this room probably has a computer and,1091.559,4.471,8cQMzVjHBeI
458,uses access to broadband if they've got,1093.99,4.439,8cQMzVjHBeI
459,it or some form of internet all the time,1096.03,5.31,8cQMzVjHBeI
460,it is the normal form of communication,1098.429,5.101,8cQMzVjHBeI
461,yet there is a big digital divide,1101.34,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
462,between those that can afford the best,1103.53,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
463,and those that don't get any whatsoever,1105.57,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
464,I just want to make sure it's equally,1107.64,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
465,available for all and over 10 years we,1109.29,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
466,would make sure it is and I think that's,1111.54,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
467,actually a sensible up-to-date modern,1113.01,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
468,way of looking at communications within,1115.32,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
469,our society so the question is can we,1117.27,4.77,8cQMzVjHBeI
470,afford it yes we can't afford it because,1119.1,5.579,8cQMzVjHBeI
471,if we don't afford it then what's the,1122.04,5.4,8cQMzVjHBeI
472,effect on areas that don't have access,1124.679,3.811,8cQMzVjHBeI
473,to broadband on their economic,1127.44,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
474,development on the investments that,1128.49,3.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
475,might come there on the businesses that,1130.71,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
476,won't go there listen talk to a business,1132.12,5.4,8cQMzVjHBeI
477,about investing in say Cumbria or say,1134.7,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
478,parts of Northumbria saying would you,1137.52,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
479,open a factory or a shop or a small,1139.2,5.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
480,business here they'd say no there's no,1141.57,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
481,broadband there isn't good train train,1144.24,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
482,access there isn't good bus access or,1146.07,4.349,8cQMzVjHBeI
483,whatever else we have to invest in,1148.29,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
484,social infrastructure and transport,1150.419,4.171,8cQMzVjHBeI
485,infrastructure for the whole country,1152.85,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
486,otherwise the north/south divide the,1154.59,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
487,inequalities between regions in England,1157.26,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
488,and between Scotland and Wales in,1159.27,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
489,England will simply get worse as a,1161.01,3.539,8cQMzVjHBeI
490,result of it this is a serious proposal,1162.78,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
491,in order to help bring economic,1164.549,4.051,8cQMzVjHBeI
492,development to all parts of our country,1166.83,3,8cQMzVjHBeI
493,and what do you make of the comments,1168.6,4.199,8cQMzVjHBeI
494,made by the in situ Fiscal Studies today,1169.83,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
495,that what do you make of the comments,1172.799,2.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
496,made by the institute of Fiscal Studies,1174.51,2.669,8cQMzVjHBeI
497,today that in order to pay for the,1175.559,2.911,8cQMzVjHBeI
498,broadband and all the other things that,1177.179,3.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
499,you're suggesting well you still what,1178.47,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
500,they're saying is you can't do that by,1180.419,3.031,8cQMzVjHBeI
501,pretending that you're just gonna text,1181.74,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
502,the very rich the top 5% you're going to,1183.45,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
503,have tax an awful lot more awful lot,1185.73,2.49,8cQMzVjHBeI
504,more of our audience,1187.35,2.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
505,I read the IFS comments very carefully,1188.22,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
506,obviously and we have here the gray buck,1190.26,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
507,that we put forward which actually funds,1192.27,3.149,8cQMzVjHBeI
508,and costs the whole of our program and,1193.95,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
509,manifesto and I was absolutely insistent,1195.419,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
510,that we as a party going into election,1197.22,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
511,put that forward that's only right that,1199.559,5.161,8cQMzVjHBeI
512,people should understand it is 95,1201.33,5.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
513,percent the population will pay no more,1204.72,5.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
514,whatsoever in tax the top 5% will pay a,1206.76,7.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
515,bit more corporation tax will go up to a,1210.63,5.64,8cQMzVjHBeI
516,maximum of 26 percent which is lower,1214.14,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
517,than it was in,1216.27,5.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
518,2010 and lower than many countries in,1218.31,5.49,8cQMzVjHBeI
519,other parts of the world including major,1221.49,4.77,8cQMzVjHBeI
520,industrial economies and we will then,1223.8,5.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
521,move into a situation where we become,1226.26,5.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
522,more or less mid-ranking in terms of,1228.84,5.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
523,provisions of funding of public services,1231.54,5.07,8cQMzVjHBeI
524,will still be way below all the,1234.06,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
525,Scandinavian countries France and,1236.61,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
526,Germany what's happened in this country,1238.59,4.98,8cQMzVjHBeI
527,for too long is we've rolled back the,1240.03,5.58,8cQMzVjHBeI
528,public realm we've rolled back on public,1243.57,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
529,services and loaded that problem onto,1245.61,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
530,individuals families and they're often,1247.92,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
531,paying with it through personal debt I,1249.96,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
532,think we need to rebalance a bit and,1251.88,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
533,start investing in people and,1254.07,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
534,communities as a whole and that's what,1255.63,11.49,8cQMzVjHBeI
535,our manifesto does hi I work for a,1257.55,11.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
536,charity that delivers Digital Inclusion,1267.12,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
537,and it's not just about broadband it's,1269.07,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
538,more than that giving broadband to house,1271.53,2.79,8cQMzVjHBeI
539,those is great but what are we going to,1273,2.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
540,do to make sure that we close the gap,1274.32,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
541,people can use Facebook people can use,1275.82,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
542,certain websites but there's other,1278.4,3.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
543,things they can't do they can't navigate,1280.11,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
544,public service websites NHS advice how,1281.43,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
545,are you going to ensure that people get,1284.73,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
546,that as well as broadband access well if,1286.05,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
547,they got good quality broadband,1288.54,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
548,obviously that's a start and clearly,1289.98,5.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
549,there has to be full accessibility to,1292.92,5.88,8cQMzVjHBeI
550,public services online because there is,1295.8,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
551,you're quite correct a digital divide,1298.8,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
552,where public service is increasing the,1300.81,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
553,doctor's appointments everything else,1303.09,2.31,8cQMzVjHBeI
554,are done online,1304.32,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
555,and there are a significant number of,1305.4,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
556,people in the country that don't,1307.53,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
557,necessarily have smartphones probably,1309.51,4.98,8cQMzVjHBeI
558,don't have computers and can't access,1312.45,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
559,those things and that becomes a form of,1314.49,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
560,social exclusion so I would always make,1316.56,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
561,it a requirement that public services,1318.6,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
562,must be available also in the more,1320.43,5.1,8cQMzVjHBeI
563,traditional ways as well so that nobody,1323.07,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
564,is left out but there's nothing worse,1325.53,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
565,than people that are told for example to,1327.03,5.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
566,go on to go online to sort out the,1329.82,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
567,universal credit can't get online,1332.46,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
568,because they haven't got a computer or a,1334.56,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
569,smartphone how on earth are they,1336.03,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
570,supposed to access universal credit in,1337.77,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
571,that sense that's why we will end,1339.81,3.09,8cQMzVjHBeI
572,universal credit and bring back a,1341.55,2.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
573,serious system,1342.9,5.809,8cQMzVjHBeI
574,[Applause],1344.2,4.509,8cQMzVjHBeI
575,I know your comment regarding a blood by,1351.25,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
576,the stuff like this very good tonight,1353.86,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
577,but one thing I want to ask right you're,1355.39,3.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
578,talking about delaying the Scottish,1357.88,3.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
579,independence referendum in Boise Joyce,1358.99,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
580,is talking about refusing a mate as the,1360.91,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
581,you keel at the Hotel California you can,1362.98,3.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
582,check out anytime you want you can never,1365.02,5.55,8cQMzVjHBeI
583,leave and the last thing a what get was,1366.61,6.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
584,Westminster the last debate Roger must,1370.57,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
585,obey the plane West it was only late it,1373.12,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
586,was to Westminster and peace telling,1374.98,4.98,8cQMzVjHBeI
587,Scott on Twitter I'm not getting chills,1378.04,3,8cQMzVjHBeI
588,don't listen to the Scottish people,1379.96,2.31,8cQMzVjHBeI
589,fussing with this overboard,1381.04,2.79,8cQMzVjHBeI
590,okay I want it before you want to miss,1382.27,2.94,8cQMzVjHBeI
591,Corbin you know I think you might,1383.83,3.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
592,practice that line before let's hear,1385.21,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
593,from max Cruikshank where I use that,1386.98,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
594,that knew that as Jeremy Scotland voted,1388.69,5.19,8cQMzVjHBeI
595,of overwhelmingly against leaving Europe,1391.51,3.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
596,and fought pro-independence,1393.88,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
597,pro-independence government why will,1395.46,5.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
598,Lieber not support us in deciding our,1397.9,5.49,8cQMzVjHBeI
599,own future okay,1401.32,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
600,thanks for your questions and thanks for,1403.39,5.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
601,the way that you've put them an incoming,1406,5.07,8cQMzVjHBeI
602,Labour government will invest a great,1408.61,6.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
603,deal across the UK including a hundred,1411.07,5.31,8cQMzVjHBeI
604,billion parents will go into Scotland,1414.64,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
605,over ten years that will be a massive,1416.38,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
606,game-changer in Scotland where you have,1418.33,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
607,the worst levels of poverty and health,1420.34,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
608,inequality in Glasgow you have serious,1422.11,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
609,levels of child poverty and housing,1424.42,3.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
610,stress you know that as well as I do,1425.89,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
611,the question is why were you not,1427.66,2.67,8cQMzVjHBeI
612,important or will you support a,1429.19,3.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
613,referendum and I'd have said that I,1430.33,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
614,don't see a priority in Scotland's of,1432.34,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
615,having an independence referendum what I,1434.8,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
616,see as a priority is investing in the,1436.42,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
617,social and capital needs of Scotland and,1438.22,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
618,so in the early years of a Labour,1440.56,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
619,government we will not be supporting an,1442.75,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
620,independence referendum instead we'll be,1444.55,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
621,investing in Scotland and working with,1446.56,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
622,whoever the government is in Scotland to,1448.36,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
623,deliver that program deliver that,1450.25,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
624,improvement in in business,1452.14,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
625,infrastructure in transport,1454.45,3.12,8cQMzVjHBeI
626,infrastructure and in the social needs,1455.83,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
627,of the people of Scotland so just so,1457.57,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
628,we're clear what does the early years,1459.28,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
629,mean is that year two year three year,1461.47,6.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
630,four early years first two years at,1464.53,6.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
631,least so not in the first two years I,1468.28,5.34,8cQMzVjHBeI
632,want to do I want to deliver I want to,1471.16,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
633,deliver a capital investment program for,1473.62,3.79,8cQMzVjHBeI
634,the whole of it you know I heard that,1475.9,3.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
635,very clearly the question is and that,1477.41,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
636,will be our focus and so it will not be,1479.66,5.07,8cQMzVjHBeI
637,in the early part of the of the new part,1481.55,5.58,8cQMzVjHBeI
638,so not in the first two years so,1484.73,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
639,certainly not 2020 is Nicola Sturgeon,1487.13,2.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
640,once yes there's a man there in the,1488.48,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
641,black shirt yes actually both got black,1490.04,9.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
642,shirts so what gives it your right to be,1493.01,8.58,8cQMzVjHBeI
643,your priority if it's a priority of the,1499.46,8.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
644,Scottish people there are factions in,1501.59,9.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
645,Scotland in 2021 and obviously the,1507.71,5.58,8cQMzVjHBeI
646,expression will come from that it is I,1510.62,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
647,think our right as a party to put,1513.29,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
648,forward a program for the whole of the,1515.45,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
649,UK and that is what we're doing an,1517.91,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
650,investment strategy for the whole of the,1519.71,4.44,8cQMzVjHBeI
651,UK and point out I point out that,1521.6,5.16,8cQMzVjHBeI
652,Scotland will get a hundred billion of,1524.15,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
653,investment under a Labour government,1526.76,3.33,8cQMzVjHBeI
654,which will make a very significant,1528.02,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
655,difference to the lives of people all,1530.09,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
656,across Scotland that I'm sure is,1532.4,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
657,something you would welcome Jeremy,1534.26,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
658,there's old idea mind it from Scottish,1536.36,5.16,8cQMzVjHBeI
659,people to have another referendum well,1538.49,7.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
660,there is actually there is a mandate,1541.52,6.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
661,from last year Scottish parliamentary,1545.84,5.64,8cQMzVjHBeI
662,elections and the Scottish people have,1548.42,5.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
663,voted for that mandate we're putting,1551.48,5.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
664,forward a proposal which I think will be,1554.27,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
665,very beneficial to all parts of the UK,1556.52,5.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
666,including Scotland and I think you have,1558.98,5.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
667,to look at the situation of the income,1561.74,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
668,and expenditure levels as they affect,1564.5,4.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
669,Scotland surely Scotland needs to be,1565.79,5.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
670,able to address the problems it has and,1569.3,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
671,the Industrial and green infrastructure,1571.64,5.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
672,investment that he absolutely needs,1574.19,6.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
673,telling me I'm sorry I know you want to,1576.85,5.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
674,fight or what there's so many hands it's,1580.67,2.61,8cQMzVjHBeI
675,not fair if I just give it all to you,1582.08,3.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
676,yes the man here in the church er yes,1583.28,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
677,what you're what you're seeing is,1585.88,6.4,8cQMzVjHBeI
678,promising things for Scotland to try and,1588.02,6.33,8cQMzVjHBeI
679,avoid on it another independence,1592.28,5.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
680,referendum it's very similar to what,1594.35,7.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
681,happened at the in 2014 with other,1597.71,6.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
682,promises made by senior label members,1601.7,8.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
683,with the fascist bow okay who can,1604.46,7.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
684,trust that this would not be an old,1609.84,5.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
685,piece of broken promises but since 2014,1611.88,4.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
686,there's been a Tory government in the UK,1615.12,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
687,and that's one of the problems we hear,1616.74,9.66,8cQMzVjHBeI
688,from the woman here in 2014 there was a,1619.11,11.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
689,triple mandate saying that we would be,1626.4,7.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
690,allowed to have a second for if it went,1630.36,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
691,against the will of the people and,1633.96,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
692,getting taken out of Europe it's against,1635.61,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
693,the will of the people in Scotland do,1637.92,2.58,8cQMzVjHBeI
694,you mind,1640.08,2.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
695,I seem to her unnervingly found all the,1640.5,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
696,stuff in the audience at one Marceau is,1642.36,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
697,happy but there are lots of questions on,1644.7,2.55,8cQMzVjHBeI

700,definitely yes at the bank is your,1648.75,6.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
701,question about Scotland slightly maybe,1651.66,5.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
702,they're very little time Leslie will be,1654.9,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
703,very brief so if you had a choice of,1657.09,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
704,getting power and sign up a deal with,1659.43,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
705,the SNP that's not going to change then,1661.5,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
706,you guys know okay Nicola will give you,1663.54,2.67,8cQMzVjHBeI

710,it's not about Scotland died I just,1668.99,4.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
711,think Jeremiah have you finally got an,1671.88,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
712,opportunity after nine years of the,1673.86,5.37,8cQMzVjHBeI
713,Tories to get rid of the legacy of,1676.05,6.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
714,Thatcher and Blair and the market and,1679.23,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
715,the things that are in your manifesto,1682.08,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
716,that improved people's lives the first,1683.85,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
717,question was about being frightened I'm,1685.8,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
718,not frightened I'm only frightened when,1687.72,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
719,I see people on the streets when I see,1689.34,3.33,8cQMzVjHBeI
720,people can't get health care all those,1691.23,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
721,things are you finding the position you,1692.67,11.07,8cQMzVjHBeI
722,win or you can put it like the woman in,1694.53,11.67,8cQMzVjHBeI
723,the back it in the green top yes and you,1703.74,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
724,say that you're not going to increase,1706.2,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
725,taxation but I've read today that in,1707.61,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
726,your manifesto it states that you're,1709.62,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
727,going to abolish the married person's,1711.66,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
728,tax for couples on a lower type of,1713.16,5.55,8cQMzVjHBeI
729,combined income I mean how can that be,1716.34,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
730,fair I mean in the last year it cost,1718.71,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
731,something like 480 million pounds and,1720.24,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
732,that's a drop in the ocean compared to,1722.49,3.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
733,what else you're planning on spending,1724.44,4.32,8cQMzVjHBeI
734,okay I'll try and do it with some of,1725.99,3.97,8cQMzVjHBeI
735,those questions but man you've got a,1728.76,2.88,8cQMzVjHBeI
736,minute left I'm afraid mr. Corbitt,1729.96,3.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
737,speaking after you about a minute let me,1731.64,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
738,do a quick first of all we're not doing,1732.99,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
739,any deals with any other parties I'm not,1736.35,2.61,8cQMzVjHBeI
740,trying to form a coalition government,1738,3.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
741,I'm fighting this election to win it for,1738.96,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
742,labour to win it for the people of this,1741.03,2.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
743,country to end you,1742.77,2.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
744,versal credit deal with the issues of,1743.85,3.829,8cQMzVjHBeI
745,inequality injustice and poverty and,1745.53,5.13,8cQMzVjHBeI
746,deliver an economy that absolutely works,1747.679,5.771,8cQMzVjHBeI
747,for all and our taxation proposals will,1750.66,5.129,8cQMzVjHBeI
748,affect the richest 5% of the people in,1753.45,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
749,this country we will end the marriage,1755.789,4.411,8cQMzVjHBeI
750,tax allowance because I think it's,1758.46,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
751,discriminatory against non married,1760.2,3,8cQMzVjHBeI
752,couples and they ought to be treated,1761.85,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
753,equally across the society an individual,1763.2,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
754,taxation is a fairer way of doing things,1765.36,5.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
755,my manifesto fully prepared fully costed,1768.09,5.61,8cQMzVjHBeI
756,I think this is an opportunity for our,1771.09,5.13,8cQMzVjHBeI
757,country to come together deal with the,1773.7,4.44,8cQMzVjHBeI
758,inequality injustice in poverty I can,1776.22,3.569,8cQMzVjHBeI
759,actually go forward to the future with,1778.14,10.529,8cQMzVjHBeI

763,us tonight you will remain neutral on,1791.76,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
764,the issue of whether or not we should,1793.409,6.451,8cQMzVjHBeI
765,remain within the mr. Corbyn thank you,1795.48,6.89,8cQMzVjHBeI

775,can say the same thing to you as I'm,1845.66,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
776,saying to all the party leaders the aim,1847.43,3.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
777,is to allow time for our lovely audience,1849.05,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
778,here you've got lots of questions lots,1850.46,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
779,of opinions already to put as many,1852.41,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
780,points to you as possible so I'll be,1854.24,2.64,8cQMzVjHBeI

782,demand to the point and forgive me if I,1856.88,5.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
783,interrupt you of course if you don't so,1859.73,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
784,let's take our first question for Nicola,1861.92,4.77,8cQMzVjHBeI
785,Sturgeon from Shirley Duncan where are,1864.26,5.61,8cQMzVjHBeI
786,you yes Shirley sturgeon if there's a,1866.69,5.1,8cQMzVjHBeI
787,hung parliament what to shorten the,1869.87,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
788,price of your cooperation with a,1871.79,4.98,8cQMzVjHBeI
789,minority government well obviously it's,1873.83,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
790,a very good and relevant question for,1876.77,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
791,everybody across the UK the SNP may well,1878.45,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
792,hold the balance of power in a hung,1880.88,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
793,parliament after this election and let,1882.86,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
794,me see we will use that influence if we,1884.96,5.64,8cQMzVjHBeI
795,have it responsibly and in the interest,1888.11,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
796,of course of standing up for Scotland,1890.6,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
797,but also in the interests of progressive,1892.28,5.07,8cQMzVjHBeI
798,values for people right across the UK,1894.32,5.37,8cQMzVjHBeI
799,and let me be very honest I could not in,1897.35,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
800,good conscience ever put Boris Johnson,1899.69,5.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
801,into number 10 Downing Street,1902.06,3.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
802,I've seen the misery that Tory policies,1910.35,6.64,8cQMzVjHBeI
803,have heaped upon people and Jeremy,1913.72,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
804,Corbyn may not be my choice of labour,1916.99,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
805,leader but I don't get to choose the,1918.73,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
806,Labour leader so in terms of what I,1920.47,5.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
807,would seek to win from a minority labour,1922.63,6.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
808,government obviously I would ask for and,1926.32,5.729,8cQMzVjHBeI
809,expect Jeremy Corbyn to respect the rate,1929.47,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
810,of the Scottish people to choose their,1932.049,3.301,8cQMzVjHBeI
811,own future because it's not for,1934.09,2.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
812,Westminster to decide it's for the,1935.35,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
813,people of Scotland but I would also want,1937,4.919,8cQMzVjHBeI
814,an interest arity I would want to see an,1939.34,5.429,8cQMzVjHBeI
815,end to the misery of universal credit I,1941.919,5.1,8cQMzVjHBeI
816,would want to see an NHS protection both,1944.769,4.081,8cQMzVjHBeI
817,so the Iranian Ches cannot be put at the,1947.019,4.441,8cQMzVjHBeI
818,mercy of Donald Trump in a trade deal I,1948.85,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
819,would want to see fear of pensions for,1951.46,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
820,our older people at the UK is one of the,1953.35,3.959,8cQMzVjHBeI
821,lowest pensions and the OECD so these,1955.21,4.049,8cQMzVjHBeI
822,are the progressive policies that the,1957.309,4.141,8cQMzVjHBeI
823,SMP would champion yes for people in,1959.259,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
824,Scotland but also for the benefit of,1961.45,3.449,8cQMzVjHBeI
825,people right across the UK ok well let's,1963.129,2.851,8cQMzVjHBeI
826,come back to his independence referendum,1964.899,3.301,8cQMzVjHBeI
827,well you talked about already at some,1965.98,4.319,8cQMzVjHBeI
828,point we've just heard the Labour leader,1968.2,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
829,saying that he would not offer you a,1970.299,4.171,8cQMzVjHBeI
830,second independence referendum for at,1972.58,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
831,least two years of a Labour government,1974.47,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
832,you said you have said many times you,1976.72,4.289,8cQMzVjHBeI
833,want to do that next year so how's that,1979.21,3.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
834,going to work well you know firstly let,1981.009,3.241,8cQMzVjHBeI
835,me explain my position and then Oh,1982.84,3.449,8cQMzVjHBeI
836,perhaps speculate on Jimmy Kaufman's if,1984.25,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
837,I me well you don't need to speculate,1986.289,3,8cQMzVjHBeI
838,because he told us that yes so would you,1987.61,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
839,accept speculate on what the position,1989.289,2.911,8cQMzVjHBeI
840,might be after the election as opposed,1990.82,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
841,to what he said here today oh I see ok,1992.2,5.579,8cQMzVjHBeI
842,my position is is one of principle,1994.96,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
843,there'll be differences of opinion in,1997.779,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
844,this room one Scottish independence of,1999.37,3.029,8cQMzVjHBeI
845,course there is a difference of opinion,2001.289,3.691,8cQMzVjHBeI
846,in Scotland on Scottish independence I,2002.399,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
847,would not be asking Jeremy Corbyn to,2004.98,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
848,support independence but simply to,2006.899,3.961,8cQMzVjHBeI
849,accept the principle that that is a,2009.33,3.329,8cQMzVjHBeI
850,question that should be decided by the,2010.86,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
851,people of Scotland not by Westminster no,2012.659,5.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
852,I guess if I can turn to the position,2015.6,4.439,8cQMzVjHBeI
853,that I think Jeremy Corbyn might take,2018.389,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
854,after an election I've heard some of,2020.039,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
855,what Jeremy Corbyn has been saying to,2022.259,3.571,8cQMzVjHBeI
856,you this evening he spoke with a lot of,2024.029,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
857,passion I don't agree with him on,2025.83,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
858,everything but I do agree with a great,2027.419,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
859,deal of what he was talking about a bit,2029.61,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
860,public spending health austerity Toby,2031.289,4.171,8cQMzVjHBeI
861,because he said not for the first two,2033.6,3.779,8cQMzVjHBeI
862,you that's the point I'm coming on time,2035.46,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
863,asking you having hair Jeremy Corbyn do,2037.379,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
864,you think he's going to walk away from,2039.87,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
865,the,2042.389,2.971,8cQMzVjHBeI
866,chance to end austerity to protect the,2043.08,5.579,8cQMzVjHBeI
867,NHS to stop universal credit simply,2045.36,5.46,8cQMzVjHBeI
868,because he wants for a couple of years,2048.659,4.111,8cQMzVjHBeI
869,to prevent Scotland to have the right to,2050.82,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
870,self-determination Jeremy Corbyn,2052.77,3.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
871,supports the right of self-determination,2054.21,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
872,for almost every other country in the,2055.8,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
873,world I'm not sure he's going to,2057.69,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
874,compromise the chance to have a Labour,2059.19,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
875,government for that issue so you think,2061.08,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
876,they wanna thing to our audience and to,2063.21,3.12,8cQMzVjHBeI
877,everyone at home and he's gonna be,2065.07,3.029,8cQMzVjHBeI
878,saying another thing - you probably look,2066.33,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
879,your putting it maybe more bluntly I,2068.099,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
880,would be more diplomatic going it like,2069.69,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
881,it is look but the point is I lead the,2071.669,4.291,8cQMzVjHBeI
882,minority government in Scotland so I,2074.22,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
883,know the compromises that you have to,2075.96,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
884,make to govern in that situation of,2078.45,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
885,course he's putting a manifesto forward,2080.97,3.929,8cQMzVjHBeI
886,but if he's in the position of needing,2083.01,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
887,the support of the SNP then I think he,2084.899,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
888,will choose to do some of the things,2087.54,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
889,that lindy's manifests and I don't think,2089.639,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
890,he'll turn his back on that in order to,2091.05,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
891,block the rate of the people of Scotland,2093.359,3.121,8cQMzVjHBeI
892,to choose their own future and I'd ask,2094.95,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
893,you to make your own minds up on that,2096.48,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
894,the men here on the front so you saying,2098.43,5.61,8cQMzVjHBeI
895,that you would prioritize the Scottish,2101.22,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
896,independence referendum over ending,2104.04,5.67,8cQMzVjHBeI
897,austerity I wouldn't the Scottish people,2106.05,4.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
898,have the right to choose their own,2109.71,2.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
899,future because fundamentally for,2110.7,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
900,Scotland we've put up with Scotland,2112.56,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
901,hasn't voted for a conservative,2115.08,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
902,Westminster government for 60 years but,2116.49,5.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
903,for 36 of those 60 years we've had to,2119.28,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
904,put up with a Tory government we are,2121.92,3.12,8cQMzVjHBeI
905,facing been taken out of the European,2123.3,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
906,Union against our will I want Scotland,2125.04,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
907,to determine our own future but in,2127.02,4.319,8cQMzVjHBeI
908,answer to your question I will never put,2129.15,5.31,8cQMzVjHBeI
909,a Tory Prime Minister into power I grew,2131.339,4.471,8cQMzVjHBeI
910,up in the West of Scotland I saw the,2134.46,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
911,damage I grew up in the factory years I,2135.81,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
912,thought the damage that Thole,2138.15,3.66,8cQMzVjHBeI
913,governments did to Scotland then to,2139.68,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
914,communities across the UK I will never,2141.81,4.529,8cQMzVjHBeI
915,support a Tory government but if Jeremy,2143.49,5.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
916,Corbyn wants the support of the SNP I,2146.339,4.081,8cQMzVjHBeI
917,don't think it should surprise people to,2148.53,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
918,hear me see that I would ask him to,2150.42,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
919,respect the rate of the people of,2152.91,3.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
920,Scotland to choose their own future and,2154.32,3.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
921,I don't think he'll turn his back on,2155.94,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
922,ending austerity in order to block that,2157.56,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
923,right okay well you heard it here folks,2159.72,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
924,I'm gonna take a few questions if you,2161.64,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
925,don't mind an impact you'd answer in a,2164.13,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
926,row yes the woman here hello yes good,2165.42,5.64,8cQMzVjHBeI
927,evening I'm at the moment the talk is,2168.33,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
928,that the UK government are focusing too,2171.06,3.32,8cQMzVjHBeI
929,much on brexit and their gay,2173.04,2.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
930,any other issues but don't you think,2174.38,3.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
931,that's happened in Scotland you know,2175.79,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
932,Jeremy Corbyn actually just brought up,2177.62,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
933,that social inequality is huge I know,2179.21,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
934,that knife crime and Glasgow,2182.21,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
935,particularly is a big problem do not,2183.62,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
936,think by leading with Scottish,2185.75,3.12,8cQMzVjHBeI
937,independence you're actually negating,2187.13,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
938,other issues like the UK government are,2188.87,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
939,doing now with brexit okay let's take a,2191.27,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
940,couple more before you answer yes the,2193.07,7.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
941,man here sorry similar I suppose um but,2194.96,8.07,8cQMzVjHBeI
942,just around if there is a Labour,2200.12,5.19,8cQMzVjHBeI
943,government that you are supporting in,2203.03,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
944,coalition then and that Labour,2205.31,5.16,8cQMzVjHBeI
945,government takes us through a second,2208.28,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
946,referendum and we don't leave Europe,2210.47,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
947,given that the labour mandate is does,2212.33,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
948,correspond to the yours quite so well,2215.18,3.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
949,will you still be pushing for a,2216.47,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
950,independence referendum for Scotland and,2218.86,5.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
951,just the men at the bank over the past,2221.09,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
952,four years we've all borne witness to,2223.91,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
953,the faster for drugs and negotiation so,2225.68,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
954,if Scotland were to get its referendum,2227.9,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
955,and it were to win what guarantees could,2229.79,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
956,you make to the rest of the Union that,2231.92,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
957,we wouldn't see the the horrible result,2233.96,4.77,8cQMzVjHBeI
958,of the brig's at negotiations with the,2236.93,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
959,tooing and throwing of their hard,2238.73,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
960,borders and customs unions and things,2240.44,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
961,like that okay lots of different,2242.03,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
962,questions it's like trying to dress I'm,2244.97,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
963,try to do it as briefly as possible on,2246.62,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
964,the the question very good question,2248.48,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
965,about I'll be prioritizing independence,2249.98,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
966,over other issues I would say that the,2252.86,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
967,evidence says no don't get me wrong,2254.21,4.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
968,Scotland has challenges all countries,2256.58,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
969,have challenges as First Minister I,2258.86,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
970,faced challenges in our public services,2260.69,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
971,every single day and my job is to,2262.85,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
972,confront those but if you look at some,2264.8,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
973,of the policies well if you look at some,2266.78,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
974,of the policies and Labor's Manifesto,2268.61,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
975,published this week if you take things,2270.56,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
976,like carefree prescriptions free,2272.33,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
977,university education restoring the,2274.37,5.58,8cQMzVjHBeI
978,nursing bursary opposition to fracking,2277.58,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
979,for example these are all things that my,2279.95,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
980,government in Scotland has already done,2282.26,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
981,so we're getting on with delivering,2284.12,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
982,those progressive policies but we want,2286.49,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
983,to be in charge of our own future not to,2288.74,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
984,turn our backs and the rest of the UK,2290.9,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
985,will always be the closest friends and,2292.61,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
986,neighbors but so that we don't get,2294.86,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
987,dragged down paths by Tory governments,2296.48,5.13,8cQMzVjHBeI
988,that we don't want to go down and the,2298.67,6.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
989,second question on if there is a second,2301.61,6.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
990,EU referendum and the UK votes,2305.51,5.61,8cQMzVjHBeI
991,and I hope that happens I've campaigned,2308.3,5.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
992,and worked as hard as possible as has,2311.12,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
993,the SNP to try to find a way for the,2313.34,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
994,whole UK to stay in the EU because I,2315.41,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
995,think that's the best future and then I,2317.69,2.94,8cQMzVjHBeI
996,won't need to call for a second in,2319.46,2.4,8cQMzVjHBeI
997,offenders referenda because they won't,2320.63,2.79,8cQMzVjHBeI
998,be the material change that you talked,2321.86,4.44,8cQMzVjHBeI
999,about last time which you need appending,2323.42,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
1000,to yourself to have won the case for,2326.3,3.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
1001,independence doesn't at rest solely on,2327.71,5.13,8cQMzVjHBeI
1002,breaks it breaks it is one example it's,2330.14,4.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
1003,a very extreme example of the way in,2332.84,4.7,8cQMzVjHBeI
1004,which Scotland is treated with contempt,2334.79,6.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
1005,often by Westminster and we've seen that,2337.54,5.32,8cQMzVjHBeI
1006,over the past three years we've tried to,2341.18,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
1007,compromise we've tried to find ways to,2342.86,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
1008,protect Scotland's and trace and that,2344.6,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1009,hasn't happened so I think Scotland does,2346.34,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
1010,need to make that choice about taking a,2348.17,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
1011,future into our own hands and thirdly,2350.33,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
1012,because this is a very good question,2353.18,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
1013,about you know will independence be as,2355.01,4.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
1014,difficult as breaks it and you know I,2357.14,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
1015,you've probably noticed this I have,2359.87,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
1016,paused breaks that I think bricks is a,2361.7,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1017,big mistake but what I don't think is,2363.23,5.16,8cQMzVjHBeI
1018,that the mess that breaks it has become,2365.78,5.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
1019,was inevitable and that was down to the,2368.39,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1020,fact that the breaks are tears if I can,2371.21,3.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
1021,be under climatic for a moment toward a,2372.89,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
1022,lotta lies on one of them on the side of,2375.05,6.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1023,a bus it was David,2377.6,3.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
1024,the fact that there was no honesty or,2383.74,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
1025,frankness about the implications no,2386.38,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
1026,planning done in advance and then Teresa,2388.03,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
1027,may come out with all these,2390.4,2.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
1028,contradictory red lines that could never,2391.24,4.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
1029,be reconciled contrast that with the,2393.22,4.77,8cQMzVjHBeI
1030,independence referendum in 2014,2396.19,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
1031,whether you agreed with the proposition,2397.99,3.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
1032,or not there was a very detailed,2399.73,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1033,proposition we done the work we'd done,2401.17,4.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
1034,the thinking we had a whole transition,2403.03,4.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
1035,program ready to go had the result gone,2405.21,4.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
1036,the other way so I don't think we should,2407.89,3.719,8cQMzVjHBeI
1037,allow the breaks of Tears who made such,2409.81,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
1038,a hash of bricks that toot are all,2411.609,5.191,8cQMzVjHBeI
1039,positive change with their brush they,2414.22,4.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
1040,may stop it doesn't mean others have to,2416.8,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
1041,mess it up as well and you want a,2419.08,5.039,8cQMzVjHBeI
1042,confirmation referendum on brexit would,2420.52,4.98,8cQMzVjHBeI
1043,you also want to confirm a tree,2424.119,3.181,8cQMzVjHBeI
1044,referendum on your pendants deal by the,2425.5,3.119,8cQMzVjHBeI
1045,same token that that is actually,2427.3,2.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
1046,connected to the answer of just given,2428.619,2.941,8cQMzVjHBeI
1047,because the reason why I did not hear,2430.21,2.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
1048,that answer would you want a,2431.56,2.7,8cQMzVjHBeI
1049,confirmatory referendum on your,2432.46,3.33,8cQMzVjHBeI
1050,independence if you let me assert my own,2434.26,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
1051,terms if I me because I was drawing the,2435.79,4.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
1052,contrast between the mace of break film,2438.07,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
1053,and the different approach taken for,2440.44,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1054,independence I don't think it was,2442.45,3.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
1055,inevitable that breaks it was amazed,2444.01,2.339,8cQMzVjHBeI
1056,therefore I don't think it was,2445.51,2.67,8cQMzVjHBeI
1057,inevitable so that were in the position,2446.349,3.331,8cQMzVjHBeI
1058,of having another resident would you,2448.18,3.659,8cQMzVjHBeI
1059,want a condo because okay so you want a,2449.68,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
1060,referendum for brexit a second well but,2451.839,3.391,8cQMzVjHBeI
1061,not for your notes do the decision,2453.49,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
1062,making is I don't think the position,2455.23,3.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
1063,we're in right now was bricks that had,2457.24,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
1064,to be like this that was down to the bad,2458.41,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1065,planning the lack of planning which I,2460.51,3.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
1066,don't think the proponents of,2462.58,2.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
1067,Independence it would allow to happen,2463.69,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
1068,can we have a Rebecca Ferguson where are,2465.4,6.98,8cQMzVjHBeI
1069,they and so I'd like to know,2468.22,6.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
1070,irrespective of maybe if we leave the EU,2472.38,7.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1071,or not if you are denied by government a,2475,7.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1072,second independence referendum for,2479.46,5.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1073,Scotland what particular action will you,2482.08,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
1074,take following that decision and whether,2484.54,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
1075,that's because they said no or whether,2487,5.19,8cQMzVjHBeI
1076,because maybe jeremy corbyn's government,2489.16,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
1077,or dragging their heels and it's going,2492.19,3.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
1078,on in your promise but you're not quite,2494.05,3.809,8cQMzVjHBeI
1079,getting it what action we take well you,2495.43,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
1080,know people understandably asked me that,2497.859,3.961,8cQMzVjHBeI
1081,all the time and and what I see and I,2500.05,2.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
1082,know it sounds like a typical,2501.82,2.549,8cQMzVjHBeI
1083,politicians we have avoiding the answer,2502.57,3.269,8cQMzVjHBeI
1084,before I see it is whenever we do on,2504.369,3.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
1085,that well not to not know because I,2505.839,4.051,8cQMzVjHBeI
1086,genuinely don't like to answer questions,2507.609,5.071,8cQMzVjHBeI
1087,that we but if I come to that point then,2509.89,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1088,I'll say how we'll cross that bridge,2512.68,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
1089,when I come to it and yes I've thought a,2514.06,3.449,8cQMzVjHBeI
1090,lot about that but I,2516.04,3.119,8cQMzVjHBeI
1091,want to talk about that right now,2517.509,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1092,because that is me considering that,2519.159,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
1093,these Westminster politicians actually,2521.679,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
1094,have a right to block Scotland's,2523.419,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
1095,ability to choose our own future and,2525.399,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
1096,actually we're in an election campaign,2527.349,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
1097,right now and people in Scotland have an,2528.789,4.44,8cQMzVjHBeI
1098,opportunity to send a very clear message,2531.489,3.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
1099,that they want to be in charge of their,2533.229,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
1100,own future and that's what I'm asking,2535.089,2.67,8cQMzVjHBeI
1101,them to do but the government does have,2536.589,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1102,a right to look it has the by Tony well,2537.759,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
1103,I don't think the immortal or a,2540.759,4.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
1104,democratic the right well it's never,2542.109,5.16,8cQMzVjHBeI
1105,been legally challenged but I've always,2545.619,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
1106,accepted and I continue to accept that,2547.269,5.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
1107,the transfer of power is necessary and,2549.639,5.37,8cQMzVjHBeI
1108,desirable but the I don't believe,2552.789,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
1109,they've got a moral or democratic right,2555.009,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
1110,and we're in an election campaign and,2556.659,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
1111,there's an opportunity for Scotland to,2558.429,4.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
1112,make that abundantly clear surely if,2560.019,4.77,8cQMzVjHBeI
1113,obviously he said you were try not to,2563.229,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
1114,give a politician's answer because it,2564.789,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
1115,would be almost conceding defeat like,2566.679,3.66,8cQMzVjHBeI
1116,they had a right to block the will of it,2568.329,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
1117,Scottish people but surely for people in,2570.339,5.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
1118,Scotland it would give them confidence,2573.219,5.13,8cQMzVjHBeI
1119,that you will see through what they want,2575.729,4.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
1120,if you actually set out your contingency,2578.349,4.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
1121,plans but if it's denied to you surely,2580.599,5.55,8cQMzVjHBeI
1122,you would want to bring Scotland,2583.299,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
1123,together and actually tell them actually,2586.149,5.55,8cQMzVjHBeI
1124,we are our own country we have we have a,2588.189,4.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
1125,right to determine our own future and,2591.699,2.97,8cQMzVjHBeI
1126,this is what we will do if we are denied,2593.139,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1127,it by this way no I think that's a fair,2594.669,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
1128,point but what I'm saying to Scotland,2596.439,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
1129,right now and as I said if I come to,2598.119,3.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
1130,that point then I will set out exactly,2599.859,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
1131,two people in Scotland what I think we,2601.719,3.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
1132,should do then but what I'm saying to,2603.849,2.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
1133,Scotland no in a general election,2604.959,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
1134,campaign is we have the ability to send,2606.669,5.19,8cQMzVjHBeI
1135,that message and make that view and that,2609.579,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1136,voice very clear and that's what I hope,2611.859,3.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
1137,people in Scotland will do for that,2614.079,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
1138,reason but I also hope the vote SNP so,2615.459,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
1139,that we can contribute to all of these,2617.499,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
1140,other social and economic policies that,2619.179,3.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
1141,I've been talking about okay there's a,2620.919,3.961,8cQMzVjHBeI
1142,few hands that let's hear from the man,2622.329,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
1143,there in the in the blue sweater in the,2624.88,5.909,8cQMzVjHBeI
1144,2014 referendum the EU turn around to,2627.249,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
1145,Scotland and said if they vote for,2630.789,3.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
1146,independence be classed as a third say,2631.989,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
1147,so they'd be out basically voting to,2633.819,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
1148,leave the EU in a sense and they'd have,2636.009,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
1149,to rejoin as an independent nation how,2638.049,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
1150,would you get around that you're you,2640.299,3.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
1151,argue that he was so against brexit and,2642.069,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
1152,so on but surely your own independence,2644.139,5.19,8cQMzVjHBeI
1153,is a another form of brexit and also,2646.419,4.471,8cQMzVjHBeI
1154,alongside that,2649.329,3.151,8cQMzVjHBeI
1155,Scotland has the issue of its deficit,2650.89,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
1156,how would you get Scotland's deficit,2652.48,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
1157,down to levels that would be acceptable,2654.16,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
1158,for the EU to admit you and you've got,2656.74,4.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
1159,the issue of Spain would Spain admit you,2659.17,4.49,8cQMzVjHBeI
1160,when they've got their own issues with,2661.69,4.889,8cQMzVjHBeI
1161,separatists in Catalonia how will you,2663.66,5.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
1162,get round that the Scotland has the,2666.579,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
1163,largest deficit in Europe at 7 percent,2668.68,3.839,8cQMzVjHBeI
1164,it needs to be 3 percent or less well in,2670.329,4.681,8cQMzVjHBeI
1165,order to connect the judges expand your,2672.519,5.07,8cQMzVjHBeI
1166,property's thing and there's a lot of,2675.01,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
1167,questions and there let me try to take,2677.589,4.291,8cQMzVjHBeI
1168,them in turn firstly with the gates of,2678.73,5.369,8cQMzVjHBeI
1169,respect you didn't see that in 2014 you,2681.88,5.429,8cQMzVjHBeI
1170,didn't make any comment about what would,2684.099,5.101,8cQMzVjHBeI
1171,happen if Scotland voted for,2687.309,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
1172,independence it certainly didn't see,2689.2,2.879,8cQMzVjHBeI
1173,that Scotland would not allow be allowed,2690.579,3.121,8cQMzVjHBeI
1174,to be a member of the European Union,2692.079,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
1175,some me have taken from the body,2693.7,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
1176,language they weren't that keen on it,2695.349,3.091,8cQMzVjHBeI
1177,but they didn't actually say that nor,2696.91,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
1178,has Spain ever said that it would veto,2698.44,5.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
1179,the membership of an independent Scot,2700.72,5.099,8cQMzVjHBeI
1180,with what Spain has said is that if it,2703.48,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
1181,is done constitutionally and legally,2705.819,5.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
1182,they would respect that and you know I'd,2708.01,6.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
1183,travel a lot around the European Union,2711.579,4.561,8cQMzVjHBeI
1184,and there's been a sea change in,2714.64,2.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
1185,attitudes to our Scottish independence,2716.14,2.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
1186,since brakes and both in the,2717.4,3.719,8cQMzVjHBeI
1187,institutions and in member states the,2718.99,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
1188,European Union since it was first,2721.119,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
1189,established has sought to enlarge itself,2722.95,4.589,8cQMzVjHBeI
1190,I think the idea that it's going to try,2725.859,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
1191,to kick out or not allow in a part of a,2727.539,5.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
1192,member state that has been there for 40,2730.869,4.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
1193,years is kind of inconceivable I'm on,2732.819,5.161,8cQMzVjHBeI
1194,the deficit can I firstly make at this,2735.519,5.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
1195,point if you exclude London because,2737.98,4.46,8cQMzVjHBeI
1196,London skews a lot of the economic,2740.799,4.141,8cQMzVjHBeI
1197,calculations for the UK Scotland's,2742.44,5.379,8cQMzVjHBeI
1198,deficit is not out of sync with the rest,2744.94,3.569,8cQMzVjHBeI
1199,of the UK,2747.819,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
1200,I think it's London is in the UK because,2748.509,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
1201,Scotland is often treated as an outlier,2752.019,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
1202,London is actually the outlier and,2753.519,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
1203,Scotland is in lane but that is we'll,2755.769,3.391,8cQMzVjHBeI
1204,leave that point to one say because I,2757.869,4.291,8cQMzVjHBeI
1205,can see I'm not convincing you but what,2759.16,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
1206,about you but a matter of it's good,2762.16,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
1207,visiting me ok but but the other point,2763.99,4.289,8cQMzVjHBeI
1208,is Scotland's deficit is falling it fell,2766.39,4.199,8cQMzVjHBeI
1209,by a billion pounds and the most recent,2768.279,4.98,8cQMzVjHBeI
1210,year our anshel revenues went up by,2770.589,4.141,8cQMzVjHBeI
1211,three billion pounds but my more,2773.259,3.481,8cQMzVjHBeI
1212,fundamental point is this if the,2774.73,4.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
1213,argument against independence is that,2776.74,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
1214,Scotland has a big deficit that is a,2779.38,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
1215,deficit that has been accrued,2781.42,4.139,8cQMzVjHBeI
1216,under the Westminster system of,2783.91,3.449,8cQMzVjHBeI
1217,governance and if we've got a big,2785.559,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
1218,deficit because of that that's not an,2787.359,2.791,8cQMzVjHBeI
1219,argument for Scotland staying the same,2788.829,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
1220,so you know what responsibilities do you,2790.15,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
1221,take for them well I don't control as,2792.849,3.391,8cQMzVjHBeI
1222,First Minister the macroeconomic,2794.53,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
1223,policies of the United Kingdom I wish I,2796.24,6.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
1224,did in some respects but I don't so,2798.76,6.029,8cQMzVjHBeI
1225,Scotland does not take all of the,2802.39,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
1226,decisions and our own government that,2804.789,3.211,8cQMzVjHBeI
1227,govern these things but the point I'm,2806.14,4.409,8cQMzVjHBeI
1228,making is if you look at independent,2808,4.319,8cQMzVjHBeI
1229,countries similar in size to Scotland,2810.549,4.171,8cQMzVjHBeI
1230,all over Europe the richer they're more,2812.319,3.061,8cQMzVjHBeI
1231,prosperous,2814.72,2.879,8cQMzVjHBeI
1232,why shouldn't Scotland with all the,2815.38,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
1233,natural and human and social resources,2817.599,5.161,8cQMzVjHBeI
1234,we have be capable of emulating that if,2819.52,5.13,8cQMzVjHBeI
1235,we have the powers to do that within our,2822.76,7.859,8cQMzVjHBeI
1236,own hands I'm an amateur chef whoever,2824.65,8.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
1237,promised once in a generation referendum,2830.619,9.571,8cQMzVjHBeI
1238,well promise that I hear it from Boris,2833.5,8.97,8cQMzVjHBeI
1239,Johnson he's it from Cordoba who,2840.19,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
1240,actually promised once in a generation,2842.47,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1241,if breaks that hadn't happened do I,2844.48,4.109,8cQMzVjHBeI
1242,think right now I would still support,2846.97,3.149,8cQMzVjHBeI
1243,independents okay I'm not going to,2848.589,2.311,8cQMzVjHBeI
1244,pretend otherwise,2850.119,2.881,8cQMzVjHBeI
1245,but do I think right now we'd be,2850.9,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1246,standing here talking about having,2853,3.329,8cQMzVjHBeI
1247,another independence referendum so,2854.47,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
1248,eminently probably not but circumstances,2856.329,5.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
1249,have changed dramatically in a democracy,2859.18,4.649,8cQMzVjHBeI
1250,what you see promised in a democracy,2861.549,5.641,8cQMzVjHBeI
1251,when circumstances change people have to,2863.829,4.98,8cQMzVjHBeI
1252,have the right to change their mind and,2867.19,3.629,8cQMzVjHBeI
1253,if they don't have that right then I,2868.809,4.081,8cQMzVjHBeI
1254,don't believe what we're living in is a,2870.819,5.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1255,democracy now,2872.89,3.229,8cQMzVjHBeI
1256,I can't force Scotland to choose and,2878.31,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
1257,depends us just as a cat force to the UK,2881.28,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1258,to stay in the EU but I do believe we,2883.14,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
1259,should have that choice,2885.45,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1260,so that whatever path we take as a,2886.95,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
1261,country whoever came the country we are,2889.02,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
1262,going to become it's one we've chosen,2891.87,3.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
1263,ourselves there's not one that we've had,2893.76,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
1264,the lakes of Boris Johnson decide for us,2895.47,4.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
1265,was what promised used if by who sorry,2897.24,5.55,8cQMzVjHBeI
1266,exactly well people say it in twenty-two,2900.27,4.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
1267,Danny buddy she promised not to my,2902.79,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
1268,knowledge but Boris Johnson keeps,2905.07,2.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
1269,repeating that,2907.17,2.79,8cQMzVjHBeI
1270,okay sure Corbin keeps repeat okay we,2907.8,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
1271,hear you I think forgive I think you've,2909.96,3.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
1272,had your so let's hear from a few more,2912,4.98,8cQMzVjHBeI
1273,people yes the woman there so in terms,2912.99,6.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
1274,of the fact that Scotland's to reduce,2916.98,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1275,its deficit in order to be allowed into,2919.05,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
1276,the EU does it therefore not make sense,2921.06,5.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
1277,that independence wouldn't be a priority,2924.06,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
1278,and jeremy corbyn's policies of putting,2926.1,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
1279,more business and more infrastructure in,2928.8,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
1280,Scotland should happen first so you then,2930.36,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
1281,can get into the EU and let's can do you,2932.76,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
1282,mind if I take a couple of my points and,2934.95,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
1283,then yes the man here sitting right by,2936.27,4.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
1284,me I can't miss him thank you Nicola our,2938.43,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
1285,grandparents fought and died to protect,2940.92,5.58,8cQMzVjHBeI
1286,Britain and the United Kingdom how would,2943.05,5.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
1287,you explain to them your desire to break,2946.5,6.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
1288,up this country yeah you don't suppose,2948.96,8.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
1289,to appear um firstly on the point of EU,2953.22,6.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
1290,membership in Scotland whether we're in,2957.87,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1291,a row of the EU wants to get its deficit,2959.61,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
1292,down to sustainable levels most,2961.95,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
1293,countries across the Western one would,2963.54,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
1294,have deficits and we've set out plans to,2965.31,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
1295,reduce that it is reducing already it's,2967.44,5.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
1296,not a condition of joining the EU to,2969.51,5.46,8cQMzVjHBeI
1297,meet those deficit levels I want to see,2972.66,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
1298,more investment in Scotland from whoever,2974.97,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1299,is in government in Westminster which is,2977.34,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
1300,why I set out the policies that the SNP,2979.47,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
1301,would want to see pursued but own,2981.72,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
1302,experience of Westminster government's,2983.73,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
1303,over a long time is that that investment,2985.62,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
1304,doesn't always come it's always also the,2987.27,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
1305,case that if you're if you want in,2990.33,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
1306,Scotland to deprive Boris Johnson of a,2991.83,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1307,majority then the way to do that is to,2994.23,3.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
1308,vote SNP because were the main,2996,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
1309,challengers in every conservative seat,2997.29,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
1310,and on the issue of our grandparents my,2999.72,4.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
1311,mother was from the north of England,3001.97,5.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
1312,much I've got many family members in,3004.45,7,8cQMzVjHBeI
1313,England I believe in independence so,3007.49,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
1314,that,3011.45,2.19,8cQMzVjHBeI
1315,Gatlin can be self-governing but the,3011.72,4.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
1316,courses ties a family of history social,3013.64,5.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
1317,ties between Scotland England Wales,3016.67,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
1318,Northern Ireland will always be close,3019.16,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
1319,and I don't believe independence for,3021.5,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
1320,Scotland is turning our backs on that,3023.18,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1321,it's simply making sure that Scotland is,3025.25,4.98,8cQMzVjHBeI
1322,in those relationships on the basis of,3027.68,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
1323,equality and I think that's a good and,3030.23,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
1324,positive thing for Scotland and actually,3032.15,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
1325,I think it would have benefits for the,3034.16,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1326,rest of the UK as well let's take a,3035.63,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
1327,question happens Steve when a white flow,3037.46,6.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
1328,yes First Minister and domestic matters,3039.44,6.929,8cQMzVjHBeI
1329,"last year there was over 1,800",3043.91,5.34,8cQMzVjHBeI
1330,probability deaths in Scotland the,3046.369,4.801,8cQMzVjHBeI
1331,highest in Europe there are three times,3049.25,3.33,8cQMzVjHBeI
1332,more likely to have a drug death in,3051.17,3.12,8cQMzVjHBeI
1333,Scotland and elsewhere in England in,3052.58,3.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
1334,wheels we're doing about it and what,3054.29,3.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
1335,needs to be done to reverse this trend,3056.18,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
1336,well it's a very good question and,3057.44,5.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
1337,firstly some context for that is you're,3059.72,6.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
1338,probably aware Scotland's because of so,3062.72,5.61,8cQMzVjHBeI
1339,disproportionately high drug use back in,3066.41,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
1340,the 1980s there's an ageing cohort of,3068.33,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
1341,drug users that have other health,3070.43,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
1342,conditions which is one it's not the,3072.08,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1343,only reason but it's one of the reasons,3073.79,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
1344,for that rising number of drugs deaths,3075.65,5.1,8cQMzVjHBeI
1345,it's a public health emergency it's not,3078.2,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1346,acceptable what we are doing about it,3080.75,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1347,we're investing more money in drug,3082.7,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
1348,treatment services we've established a,3084.92,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
1349,task force made up of experts but also,3087.08,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
1350,people with lived experience of drug use,3089.66,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
1351,to look at the different more innovative,3091.82,5.789,8cQMzVjHBeI
1352,things that we need to do power over the,3094.07,5.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
1353,classification of drugs is still held at,3097.609,3.781,8cQMzVjHBeI
1354,Westminster one of the things that,3099.92,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
1355,Glasgow City Council is wanting to do,3101.39,5.79,8cQMzVjHBeI
1356,and we are seeking the power in order to,3104.93,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1357,do that is to establish in Glasgow,3107.18,4.409,8cQMzVjHBeI
1358,what's called a safe consumption room so,3109.43,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
1359,that we can try to reduce some of the,3111.589,3.991,8cQMzVjHBeI
1360,the harm related to drugs but this is,3113.24,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
1361,one of the most important issues that,3115.58,3.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
1362,we're facing in Scotland and I think,3117.71,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
1363,there is a real deter and know there is,3119.21,3.12,8cQMzVjHBeI
1364,a real determination but I think it,3120.92,3.179,8cQMzVjHBeI
1365,exists across parties to do absolutely,3122.33,5.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
1366,that there's no indicate that on 20,3124.099,7.051,8cQMzVjHBeI
1367,actually be higher this year minus 5,3128.24,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1368,from the drug death so she up-to-date,3131.15,3.959,8cQMzVjHBeI
1369,the no listen to it so the policies what,3132.74,5.31,8cQMzVjHBeI
1370,can just know em this that is more to do,3135.109,5.551,8cQMzVjHBeI
1371,so the some of these policies will be,3138.05,4.289,8cQMzVjHBeI
1372,starting to have an effect but it will,3140.66,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
1373,take longer in some respects so I'm not,3142.339,2.761,8cQMzVjHBeI
1374,going to,3144.56,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
1375,tear and make promises about that I,3145.1,6.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
1376,can't necessarily deliver in the year,3148.49,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
1377,time scale that you're talking about,3151.34,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
1378,what I can see with absolute conviction,3152.63,5.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
1379,is that there is a real determination to,3155.03,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
1380,tackle this and to do what is required,3157.91,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
1381,over whatever period is required,3159.74,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
1382,I don't want not just to be first,3161.96,3.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
1383,minister of a country I don't want to be,3163.7,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
1384,a citizen of a country in which we've,3165.14,5.64,8cQMzVjHBeI
1385,got people dying unnecessarily of drug,3167.15,6.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
1386,use so we are determine with if you take,3170.78,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
1387,alcohol misuse for example which is not,3173.39,5.1,8cQMzVjHBeI
1388,the same we've implemented for example,3175.46,4.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
1389,minimum unit pricing so we've got a,3178.49,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
1390,record as a country of doing really,3180.26,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1391,courageous things when it comes to,3182.27,2.97,8cQMzVjHBeI
1392,public health and we've got to show that,3183.83,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
1393,same determination here to character,3185.24,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
1394,it's just booth here somewhere,3187.22,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
1395,is that you I've signed you because I,3188.96,3.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
1396,know you have from the questions you,3190.49,2.34,8cQMzVjHBeI
1397,submitted you have personally,3192.02,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
1398,experienced of this I do yeah and I am,3192.83,6.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
1399,the recovering addict I had an issue,3195.74,6.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
1400,with benzodiazepines and in the report,3199.22,5.13,8cQMzVjHBeI
1401,that the gentleman's reference up there,3202.73,5.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
1402,and you talked about older you know,3204.35,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
1403,people who have been through and drop,3207.77,3.12,8cQMzVjHBeI
1404,related thinking in the 80s and things,3209.24,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1405,like that but actually one of the,3210.89,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1406,biggest contributors to rise and deaths,3212.54,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
1407,is around benzodiazepines and the amount,3214.46,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
1408,that they are just prescribed to people,3216.8,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
1409,who are in alcohol withdrawal rules or,3219.35,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
1410,who are suffering from anxiety suffering,3221.36,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
1411,from mental health and there seems to be,3223.46,5.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
1412,a real lack of education around what,3224.81,5.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
1413,these drugs can do to people and how,3228.5,5.37,8cQMzVjHBeI
1414,quickly it can ruin your life I came to,3230.54,7.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
1415,the brink of death on these drugs and,3233.87,6.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
1416,I'm very long one of the lucky ones and,3237.82,4.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1417,I feel like that is a situation that's,3240.83,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
1418,not only being not really looked at,3242.39,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1419,properly in Scotland but also throughout,3244.31,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
1420,the whole of the UK,3246.47,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
1421,you know I think that is absolutely,3247.7,4.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
1422,right and,3249.95,2.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
1423,given given you excuse me a second given,3254.21,6.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
1424,you experience if you were willing I,3258.599,3.871,8cQMzVjHBeI
1425,would love to talk to you a bit more,3260.43,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
1426,than perhaps put you in touch with some,3262.47,2.609,8cQMzVjHBeI
1427,of the people within the Scottish,3263.79,2.4,8cQMzVjHBeI
1428,government that are working on this,3265.079,2.911,8cQMzVjHBeI
1429,because it's really important that we do,3266.19,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
1430,listen to people who have experience so,3267.99,3.599,8cQMzVjHBeI
1431,that we can learn from that and make,3270.48,2.849,8cQMzVjHBeI
1432,sure that the policies were taking,3271.589,3.541,8cQMzVjHBeI
1433,forward properly reflect that so if you,3273.329,3.361,8cQMzVjHBeI
1434,are willing to leave your details there,3275.13,8.729,8cQMzVjHBeI
1435,I would love to follow that and if you,3276.69,8.79,8cQMzVjHBeI
1436,were in the coalition government what,3283.859,3.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
1437,would you do to make sure that those,3285.48,3.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
1438,outside London and are better,3287.099,3.331,8cQMzVjHBeI
1439,represented in Westminster not just,3288.54,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
1440,Scottish people and well that's a very,3290.43,4.649,8cQMzVjHBeI
1441,good just kind of fight firstly not to,3293.13,3.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
1442,dodge the question because I'll come on,3295.079,3.181,8cQMzVjHBeI
1443,- I don't envisage being in a coalition,3296.28,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
1444,government with labour I think it would,3298.26,4.589,8cQMzVjHBeI
1445,be a less formal arrangement than that,3301.2,4.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
1446,if we're in that situation but you know,3302.849,6.811,8cQMzVjHBeI
1447,many of the areas of England suffer from,3305.93,6.49,8cQMzVjHBeI
1448,much the same neglect as Scotland does,3309.66,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
1449,and much the same contempt from,3312.42,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
1450,Westminster as Scotland does so the SNP,3314.07,5.4,8cQMzVjHBeI
1451,will always try to stand up for,3316.95,4.889,8cQMzVjHBeI
1452,decentralization from London much of,3319.47,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
1453,what we've been able to do because we,3321.839,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
1454,have a Scottish Parliament some of the,3323.4,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
1455,policies that Labour Tarnow promising in,3325.589,4.621,8cQMzVjHBeI
1456,the UK manifesto I think with more power,3327.51,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
1457,with more devolution to some of the,3330.21,4.139,8cQMzVjHBeI
1458,regions of England it would be possible,3332.13,4.709,8cQMzVjHBeI
1459,there as well so the SNP will always be,3334.349,4.801,8cQMzVjHBeI
1460,a voice for decentralization and more,3336.839,4.891,8cQMzVjHBeI
1461,powers to be spread around so how much,3339.15,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
1462,so if you were in some kind of agreement,3341.73,3.119,8cQMzVjHBeI
1463,confident supply whatever it might be,3343.44,3.419,8cQMzVjHBeI
1464,with a Labour minority government should,3344.849,3.571,8cQMzVjHBeI
1465,that come to pass how much involvement,3346.859,3.301,8cQMzVjHBeI
1466,do you see then from that question yes,3348.42,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
1467,n't be having in a fair,3350.16,3.199,8cQMzVjHBeI
1468,south-of-the-border did you see yourself,3351.9,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
1469,actually getting stuck in in terms of,3353.359,4.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
1470,the laws that are are passed,3355.71,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
1471,look for the rest of the UK no no we,3357.569,3.691,8cQMzVjHBeI
1472,would always respect so we are,3359.67,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
1473,responsible in Scotland for health,3361.26,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
1474,policy and education for example I don't,3363.21,3.869,8cQMzVjHBeI
1475,think it's right that we would seek to,3365.13,4.229,8cQMzVjHBeI
1476,you know no more right than it would be,3367.079,4.111,8cQMzVjHBeI
1477,for Westminster to dictate to Scotland,3369.359,4.141,8cQMzVjHBeI
1478,that we would dictate health policy or,3371.19,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
1479,education policy in England except where,3373.5,3.869,8cQMzVjHBeI
1480,that affects cotton because often the,3375.3,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
1481,decisions are taken around Westminster,3377.369,4.081,8cQMzVjHBeI
1482,on the health service for example have,3379.89,3.689,8cQMzVjHBeI
1483,implications for our budget and one of,3381.45,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
1484,the big issues in the next parliament,3383.579,3.391,8cQMzVjHBeI
1485,potentially for the health service is,3384.9,2.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
1486,trade deals,3386.97,3.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
1487,and we all have to come together those,3387.72,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
1488,of us who do one already HS sold off to,3390.15,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
1489,make sure that that doesn't happen so we,3392.43,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
1490,will seek to exercise influence of,3394.08,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
1491,course in Scotland's interests but,3396.72,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
1492,whether it is appropriate in the,3398.43,4.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
1493,interests of people right across the UK,3400.23,7.889,8cQMzVjHBeI
1494,Romania you've talked about economics,3402.71,7.899,8cQMzVjHBeI
1495,and the deficit and and I know Scotland,3408.119,4.891,8cQMzVjHBeI
1496,relies a lot too because in order to,3410.609,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
1497,have your freedom you're gonna need,3413.01,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
1498,money to do this and you're you,3414.869,6.271,8cQMzVjHBeI
1499,mentioned resources and the North Sea is,3417.42,5.88,8cQMzVjHBeI
1500,one of these key areas that is often,3421.14,7.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
1501,raised is is it not important to let go,3423.3,7.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
1502,of that now to strand those assets and,3428.4,6.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
1503,and grow the natural resources like wind,3431.01,6.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
1504,and tidal the that Scotland is doing so,3434.46,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
1505,much and raised the money that way,3437.22,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
1506,rather than the oil and gas industry I'm,3438.48,5.369,8cQMzVjHBeI
1507,in I won't you're right I agree with the,3440.64,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
1508,sentiment so if if I've got the time,3443.849,3.361,8cQMzVjHBeI
1509,just slightly on you got about a minute,3445.53,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
1510,Scotland is already you render by eighty,3447.21,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1511,percent of our electricity comes from,3449.34,3.779,8cQMzVjHBeI
1512,renewable sources already if we were to,3450.78,4.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
1513,stop oil and gas production tomorrow we,3453.119,5.281,8cQMzVjHBeI
1514,would become more dependent on imports,3455.64,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
1515,which would actually increase the carbon,3458.4,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
1516,footprint so we've got to have a managed,3459.99,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
1517,transition and adjust transition that,3461.79,5.16,8cQMzVjHBeI
1518,transition is underway rightly so we've,3464.52,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
1519,got to accelerate it we've got an air,3466.95,4.409,8cQMzVjHBeI
1520,zero target in Scotland in law already,3468.93,5.49,8cQMzVjHBeI
1521,of net zero emissions by 2045 that's,3471.359,5.281,8cQMzVjHBeI
1522,five years ahead of the rest of the UK,3474.42,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
1523,so we've got to power on with these,3476.64,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
1524,things and we're absolutely focused on,3478.8,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
1525,doing it right well this been quite a,3480.39,4.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
1526,few questions but we for the moment are,3482.67,4.169,8cQMzVjHBeI
1527,out of time so First Minister Nicola,3485.25,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI

1529,you,3488.52,2.12,8cQMzVjHBeI
1530,okay so we are halfway through two down,3497.93,7.649,8cQMzVjHBeI
1531,two to go still got lots of energy oh,3502.47,6.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
1532,great okay so we're going to end with,3505.579,3.79,8cQMzVjHBeI
1533,the Prime Minister,3508.65,2.219,8cQMzVjHBeI
1534,Boris Johnson but first let's welcome,3509.369,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
1535,the leader of the Liberal Democrats Joe,3510.869,5.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
1536,Swenson,3514.049,2.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
1537,so welcome to this leaders question town,3522.02,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
1538,I can make the same plane to you you've,3524.57,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1539,probably heard it simply for brevity and,3526.01,5.79,8cQMzVjHBeI
1540,relevance that's what we want isn't it,3528.74,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1541,and if you've been watching you'll know,3531.8,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
1542,that the audience has a lot of questions,3533.24,3.359,8cQMzVjHBeI
1543,and I'm sure you want to hear as much in,3535.19,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
1544,them as possible so let's get stuck in,3536.599,4.471,8cQMzVjHBeI
1545,so our first question for you is from,3539.06,5.66,8cQMzVjHBeI
1546,James McLaughlin hi,3541.07,3.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
1547,do you regret starting off the campaign,3545.119,5.281,8cQMzVjHBeI
1548,by saying that you could be p.m. and do,3547.79,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1549,you know agree how ridiculous that,3550.4,12.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
1550,sounded just start with easy ones no I,3551.96,13.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
1551,don't I don't regret it and I'll tell,3562.55,5.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
1552,you why I think many of you might have,3565.07,5.46,8cQMzVjHBeI
1553,watched that debate on Monday night,3568.28,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
1554,between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn,3570.53,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
1555,and I don't know how you felt about it,3572.75,5.609,8cQMzVjHBeI
1556,but when I watched that I felt pretty,3575.45,5.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
1557,dismayed with the thought that somehow,3578.359,4.321,8cQMzVjHBeI
1558,that has to be the choice but that's all,3580.73,4.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
1559,that we get to choose between and I'm in,3582.68,4.409,8cQMzVjHBeI
1560,the position of leading a political,3585.53,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
1561,party with standing in more than 600,3587.089,5.131,8cQMzVjHBeI
1562,seats at this election and I'm proud to,3589.4,5.4,8cQMzVjHBeI
1563,say that you don't have to make a choice,3592.22,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1564,between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn,3594.8,4.549,8cQMzVjHBeI
1565,there is a better alternative because I,3596.72,5.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
1566,truly believe that our country deserves,3599.349,5.201,8cQMzVjHBeI
1567,a better and brighter future what then,3602.57,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
1568,what either of them is offering right,3604.55,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
1569,now and I'm determined in my rule as,3606.71,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
1570,Liberal Democrat leader to do everything,3608.45,4.409,8cQMzVjHBeI
1571,I possibly can to make that happen,3610.49,4.859,8cQMzVjHBeI
1572,there's our usual saying that you could,3612.859,3.961,8cQMzVjHBeI
1573,be Prime Minister that's the heart of,3615.349,2.851,8cQMzVjHBeI
1574,the question there's still three weeks,3616.82,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
1575,left in this campaign and all I would,3618.2,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
1576,say is to anybody that thinks that you,3620.72,3.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
1577,can predict the outcome of the election,3622.94,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
1578,in the middle of the campaign asked,3624.56,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1579,resume how that worked out last time,3626.63,5.219,8cQMzVjHBeI
1580,around okay but you would need a tsunami,3628.64,6.959,8cQMzVjHBeI
1581,of seats 340 so to ask the gentleman's,3631.849,5.221,8cQMzVjHBeI
1582,question are you still saying that you,3635.599,3.841,8cQMzVjHBeI
1583,could P Prime Minister look I recognized,3637.07,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
1584,that things have got much more,3639.44,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1585,challenging since Boris Johnson and,3641.69,5.429,8cQMzVjHBeI
1586,Niger Faraj cooked up a deal to to,3643.52,5.88,8cQMzVjHBeI
1587,stitch up seats between them I get that,3647.119,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1588,it is a big ask but I am absolutely,3649.4,3.959,8cQMzVjHBeI
1589,fighting for every Liberal Democrat vote,3651.619,3.661,8cQMzVjHBeI
1590,and for every liberal Democrat seat,3653.359,4.021,8cQMzVjHBeI
1591,and we do live in a world without yes or,3655.28,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
1592,no we do live in a world where sometimes,3657.38,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
1593,strange things have happened in politics,3659.18,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
1594,you know I predict that Trump was going,3660.77,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
1595,to become president I didn't I didn't,3662.63,3.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
1596,think Jeremy Corbyn was going to become,3664.67,2.79,8cQMzVjHBeI
1597,leader the Labour Party so you know I,3665.78,2.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
1598,think we've all made some predictions,3667.46,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
1599,which have not turned out to to come,3668.6,4.55,8cQMzVjHBeI
1600,true okay the woman in the red jacket,3670.85,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
1601,talk about the Lib Dems as a viable,3673.15,5.77,8cQMzVjHBeI
1602,alternative to labor or the Tories I,3675.77,5.88,8cQMzVjHBeI
1603,just like to ask you work with 14,3678.92,5.31,8cQMzVjHBeI
1604,million UK citizens now living in,3681.65,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
1605,poverty,3684.23,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
1606,do you regret consistently voting with,3684.86,5.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
1607,the Conservatives in favor of harsh and,3687.92,5.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
1608,uncaring benefit cuts and how does that,3690.68,12.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
1609,I mean I absolutely recognize the issue,3693.64,11.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1610,that you're raising and the bottom line,3702.71,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1611,is that there are far far too many,3704.72,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
1612,people in our country living in poverty,3706.79,5.37,8cQMzVjHBeI
1613,and life is too hard and we did not get,3708.95,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
1614,everything right so should we just look,3712.16,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
1615,at your voting record in government you,3713.78,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
1616,voted for the bedroom tax yeah you,3715.88,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
1617,frequently voted against raising,3717.98,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
1618,benefits and freely voted against paying,3719.09,4.77,8cQMzVjHBeI
1619,higher benefits to people with illnesses,3721.73,6.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
1620,or disabilities so as I was saying we,3723.86,6.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1621,didn't get everything right wheat not,3728.12,6.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
1622,you and you know we also had plenty of,3730.16,6.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
1623,fights with the Conservatives and we won,3734.39,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1624,some of those fights and we lost some of,3736.52,3.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
1625,those fights and I am sorry that we did,3738.56,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1626,not win more of those fights in,3740.36,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
1627,coalition because of the reasons that,3741.86,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
1628,you are outlining now we did stop the,3744.23,3.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
1629,Conservatives cutting 12 billion more,3746.21,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
1630,from welfare we did stop them bringing,3748.07,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
1631,in the two-child cap which they did of,3749.66,3.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
1632,course when they were on their own in,3751.94,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
1633,2015 but I absolutely think that we have,3753.31,5.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
1634,lessons to learn from that I've learned,3756.65,3.09,8cQMzVjHBeI
1635,those lessons and if you look at what,3758.36,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
1636,we're setting out we are identifying six,3759.74,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1637,billion extra to put into universal,3761.9,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
1638,credit to make sure that you don't have,3764.24,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
1639,that five-week weight which is hurting,3765.95,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
1640,so many people so that we get rid of,3768.17,3.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
1641,that two-child cap when we get rid of,3770.18,4.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
1642,the bedroom tax so I get it we got stuff,3771.77,6.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
1643,wrong and we in the future going forward,3775.13,4.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
1644,are determined to get it right,3777.92,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
1645,does that satisfy you not at all not in,3779.56,4.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
1646,the slightest bit you're still going to,3782.39,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
1647,keep the universal credit which,3784.46,4.599,8cQMzVjHBeI
1648,everybody knows is not working at all,3786.59,3.879,8cQMzVjHBeI
1649,the Labour Party has made it absolutely,3789.059,3.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
1650,clear that they're going to get rid of,3790.469,4.32,8cQMzVjHBeI
1651,universal credit credit and quite right,3792.689,4.711,8cQMzVjHBeI
1652,and I can't honestly say that I could,3794.789,5.37,8cQMzVjHBeI
1653,ever trust after what happened in,3797.4,4.889,8cQMzVjHBeI
1654,Sheffield and we know all about that in,3800.159,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1655,Sheffield when the Lib Dems went into,3802.289,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
1656,coalition with the Conservatives how can,3804.329,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
1657,we expect you to believing anything you,3806.669,11.16,8cQMzVjHBeI
1658,say on this issue I absolutely accept,3809.219,10.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1659,the way that you feel and I might not be,3817.829,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
1660,able to convince you on this and I,3819.719,3.921,8cQMzVjHBeI
1661,recognize that you know I do think that,3821.249,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
1662,whatever you know scrapping the,3823.64,3.429,8cQMzVjHBeI
1663,universal credit on its own isn't some,3825.599,2.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
1664,kind of magic bullet we need to have a,3827.069,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
1665,system that provides support to people I,3828.509,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
1666,think the biggest problems with,3830.429,3.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
1667,universal credit is the lack of money,3831.719,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
1668,that's in it not the principle that you,3833.669,3.961,8cQMzVjHBeI
1669,try to have a simpler benefit system,3835.529,3.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
1670,instead of there being multiple,3837.63,3.209,8cQMzVjHBeI
1671,different payments that creates more,3838.769,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1672,complexity so I think the principle of,3840.839,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
1673,making it simpler is a good one but it,3842.939,3.691,8cQMzVjHBeI
1674,needs to have the money behind it and,3844.979,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
1675,that's what we're setting out to do okay,3846.63,4.079,8cQMzVjHBeI
1676,I want to take one of these nice,3848.969,2.7,8cQMzVjHBeI
1677,slightly different I want to take two,3850.709,3.181,8cQMzVjHBeI
1678,questions in a row from two new people,3851.669,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
1679,so can I hear from Catherine Fox and,3853.89,5.039,8cQMzVjHBeI
1680,then sue link offski so Catherine that's,3855.659,5.731,8cQMzVjHBeI
1681,you over there right is refill keen,3858.929,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
1682,article 50 confirming to seventeen point,3861.39,4.019,8cQMzVjHBeI
1683,four million people that you think my,3863.759,2.97,8cQMzVjHBeI
1684,stupid didn't know what you're voting,3865.409,9.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
1685,for passionate remainer but the Liberal,3866.729,10.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
1686,Democrat standing on a manifesto to,3875.009,6.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1687,unilaterally cancel brexit and the,3877.559,6.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
1688,electoral pact has absolutely cost you,3881.309,5.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
1689,my vote the Liberal Democratic Party,3884.009,6.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
1690,title is now a misnomer how can you,3886.739,12.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
1691,defend that decision okay um and what I,3890.219,11.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
1692,would say in terms of our policy look we,3899.279,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
1693,are being very straightforward as a,3902.039,3.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
1694,party that we want to stop right there,3903.869,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
1695,you may agree with us you might disagree,3905.219,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1696,with us I don't think you could accuse,3907.349,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
1697,us of not being upfront about wanting to,3909.299,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1698,stop Briggs that we have been crystal,3911.339,3.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
1699,clear about that from the very beginning,3912.869,5.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
1700,not for one second do I think that that,3914.519,7.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
1701,means that you or anybody like you is,3918.599,4.041,8cQMzVjHBeI
1702,stupid I,3921.569,4.401,8cQMzVjHBeI
1703,it means we disagree and I really want,3922.64,5.429,8cQMzVjHBeI
1704,us to be in a situation in this country,3925.97,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
1705,where we can disagree with each other,3928.069,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
1706,Katherine and that means that you want,3930.5,3.809,8cQMzVjHBeI
1707,to leave and I don't think that makes,3932.539,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
1708,you a bad person and I want to remain in,3934.309,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
1709,the EU and I hope you think that doesn't,3936.589,3.541,8cQMzVjHBeI
1710,make me a bad person disagree with me,3938.089,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
1711,what you lost and I don't get to keep,3940.13,4.469,8cQMzVjHBeI
1712,disagreed you'll get to change it,3943.099,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
1713,because your lives I haven't I haven't,3944.599,4.411,8cQMzVjHBeI
1714,changed my view on whether I think we,3946.519,4.971,8cQMzVjHBeI
1715,are better off in the European Union and,3949.01,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1716,watching what I have seen in the last,3951.49,4.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
1717,three and a half years watching in,3953.51,6.539,8cQMzVjHBeI
1718,Parliament MPs who voted to leave who,3956,6.809,8cQMzVjHBeI
1719,want breaks it unable to agree amongst,3960.049,5.101,8cQMzVjHBeI
1720,themselves about what breaks it looks,3962.809,4.921,8cQMzVjHBeI
1721,like so treasom a proposes a break set,3965.15,4.139,8cQMzVjHBeI
1722,that Boris Johnson doesn't think is,3967.73,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
1723,Briggs t enough Boris Johnson proposes a,3969.289,3.361,8cQMzVjHBeI
1724,break said that first of all Nyjah,3971.48,2.94,8cQMzVjHBeI
1725,Ferrara says he can't handle but then,3972.65,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
1726,who knows what discussions they've had,3974.42,3.689,8cQMzVjHBeI
1727,and what's been offered in order to get,3976.19,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
1728,him on board if even those MPs who have,3978.109,5.071,8cQMzVjHBeI
1729,been putting forward brakes that can't,3981.44,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
1730,agree I tell you I genuinely don't have,3983.18,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
1731,confidence there there is a majority in,3985.49,5.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
1732,this country for any specific type of,3988.19,4.77,8cQMzVjHBeI
1733,break set and when the government,3990.92,4.199,8cQMzVjHBeI
1734,analysis says that breaks that will make,3992.96,4.049,8cQMzVjHBeI
1735,our country poorer and it will mean,3995.119,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
1736,people lose their jobs and there is less,3997.009,5.431,8cQMzVjHBeI
1737,money for our NHS if we really don't,3999.529,4.711,8cQMzVjHBeI
1738,think that there is a majority for any,4002.44,4.109,8cQMzVjHBeI
1739,specific type of break set I think it,4004.24,3.809,8cQMzVjHBeI
1740,would be irresponsible to go ahead with,4006.549,3.601,8cQMzVjHBeI
1741,that without at least checking so we've,4008.049,4.98,8cQMzVjHBeI
1742,argued for a people's vote okay but are,4010.15,4.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
1743,you saying if you vote Liberal Democrat,4013.029,3.691,8cQMzVjHBeI
1744,and get a Lib Dem majority government we,4014.95,3.359,8cQMzVjHBeI
1745,will revoke article v so and if you,4016.72,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
1746,don't we will argue so what do you say,4018.309,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
1747,to your former Liv don't vote in here,4020.14,3.449,8cQMzVjHBeI
1748,and you know we vote you you're not,4021.579,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
1749,saying we'll go back to the people you,4023.589,5.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
1750,are unilaterally saying revoke it that,4025.809,6.631,8cQMzVjHBeI
1751,is undemocratic from somebody who wishes,4029.109,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
1752,the last three and a half years had,4032.44,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
1753,never happened there is no difference,4034.029,4.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
1754,between the parity,4035.95,2.809,8cQMzVjHBeI
1755,so I suspect you want a people's vote,4041.839,7.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1756,that's me is the only way forward,4046.01,6.7,8cQMzVjHBeI
1757,recognizing people who are strongly to,4049.339,6.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
1758,leave so so we have been leading the,4052.71,4.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
1759,fight for a people's vote for three and,4055.619,3.511,8cQMzVjHBeI
1760,a half years yeah but you're not now you,4057.66,6.929,8cQMzVjHBeI
1761,know revoking 50 17 times in Parliament,4059.13,7.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
1762,we put down amendments to try to secure,4064.589,4.951,8cQMzVjHBeI
1763,a people's vote if Jeremy Corbyn and the,4066.93,4.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
1764,Labour Party had backed that with,4069.54,4.319,8cQMzVjHBeI
1765,sincerity then we might be having a,4071.73,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
1766,people's vote right now instead of a,4073.859,4.861,8cQMzVjHBeI
1767,general election but we are in a general,4076.41,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
1768,election you know this is the essence of,4078.72,4.349,8cQMzVjHBeI
1769,democracy I am standing here and telling,4081.03,4.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
1770,you honestly what I would do if I was,4083.069,4.591,8cQMzVjHBeI
1771,elected as Prime Minister I would revoke,4085.68,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
1772,article 50 and if you vote me into that,4087.66,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
1773,position I will do what I've said I will,4089.55,4.37,8cQMzVjHBeI
1774,do and that's the essence of democracy,4091.71,4.589,8cQMzVjHBeI
1775,these two women in the front here let's,4093.92,4.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
1776,hear from both of you he said you made,4096.299,3.391,8cQMzVjHBeI
1777,some mistakes when you were in coalition,4097.98,3.359,8cQMzVjHBeI
1778,with the Tories so can you confirm,4099.69,3.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
1779,whether you would go into a coalition,4101.339,2.761,8cQMzVjHBeI
1780,with them again,4102.75,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
1781,certainly not under Boris Johnson this,4104.1,5.009,8cQMzVjHBeI
1782,conservative party is you know off with,4106.44,5.129,8cQMzVjHBeI
1783,knowledge of Faraj Boris Johnson's been,4109.109,5.521,8cQMzVjHBeI
1784,endorsed by Tommy Robinson I mean my,4111.569,4.561,8cQMzVjHBeI
1785,goodness they are they are so far off,4114.63,3.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
1786,off the charts absolutely not,4116.13,5.209,8cQMzVjHBeI
1787,there's a woman at the back phases yeah,4118.23,6.66,8cQMzVjHBeI
1788,so you've made some mistakes and I'm a,4121.339,5.471,8cQMzVjHBeI
1789,student so we've been let down by the,4124.89,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
1790,lift ends before are you talking about,4126.81,6.509,8cQMzVjHBeI
1791,tuition please ponytail yeah but you,4128.88,7.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
1792,also kind of called out Morrison Nigel,4133.319,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
1793,for making a deal but the Lib Dems have,4136.02,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1794,been making packs and there's definitely,4138.569,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
1795,been some misleading suggestions in,4140.19,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
1796,their campaign so I don't what's,4142.799,3.391,8cQMzVjHBeI
1797,different now why can we trust you now,4144.9,2.549,8cQMzVjHBeI
1798,and what do you mean misleading,4146.19,3.359,8cQMzVjHBeI
1799,suggestions in their campaign there's,4147.449,6.861,8cQMzVjHBeI
1800,been some some claims made that they,4149.549,7.531,8cQMzVjHBeI
1801,wasn't there miss Winston in the,4154.31,3.909,8cQMzVjHBeI
1802,northeast time so literature which,4157.08,2.759,8cQMzVjHBeI
1803,suggested that we just kind of forgot,4158.219,3.211,8cQMzVjHBeI
1804,all about the bricks in the Labour Party,4159.839,4.741,8cQMzVjHBeI
1805,in that bar chart and misrepresented,4161.43,5.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
1806,access of the Lib Dems in it I haven't,4164.58,4.139,8cQMzVjHBeI
1807,seen that that particular one and it may,4166.71,3.839,8cQMzVjHBeI
1808,well be that there was a problem with it,4168.719,2.271,8cQMzVjHBeI
1809,I think,4170.549,1.611,8cQMzVjHBeI
1810,all bar charts should be properly,4170.99,2.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
1811,labeled it should be clear what they are,4172.16,4.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
1812,explaining a bit of a data geek I do,4173.9,5.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
1813,like a bar chart I will be fairly okay,4177.02,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
1814,need to divide by sorry they need to be,4178.94,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
1815,right yeah and that one wasn't yeah they,4181.04,3.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
1816,do need to be right and there needs to,4183.2,2.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
1817,be clear what it what it is representing,4184.19,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
1818,I absolutely absolutely take that point,4186.05,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
1819,but I mean on that on that wider issue,4187.88,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
1820,of trust,4189.56,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
1821,look we absolutely got it wrong on,4191.24,4.32,8cQMzVjHBeI
1822,tuition fees and you know I do apologize,4192.92,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1823,that we got that wrong and that we did,4195.56,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1824,that what I think we have been doing in,4197.09,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
1825,the last three and a half years its,4199.64,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
1826,standing really clearly as a,4201.62,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
1827,pro-european Pro remain party and we've,4203.66,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
1828,not wavered from that we've absolutely,4206.54,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1829,set that out and that is what is at the,4208.37,3.66,8cQMzVjHBeI
1830,center of our manifesto this time so you,4210.11,3.36,8cQMzVjHBeI
1831,can see that we are sticking to our,4212.03,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
1832,principles and what we believe in and do,4213.47,5.07,8cQMzVjHBeI
1833,you think just seeing the silence of,4215.81,5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1834,that fell into do you think that the,4218.54,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
1835,policy of revoking article 50 has,4220.81,6.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
1836,backfired well you know it is what we,4223.28,7.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
1837,would do if we win a majority right I,4227.54,5.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
1838,just think we have to level and be,4231.14,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
1839,straightforward about it,4233.3,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
1840,we are a pro-european party we always,4234.35,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
1841,have been and if we fight an election on,4236.75,4.32,8cQMzVjHBeI
1842,the basis of stopping breaks there and,4238.88,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
1843,people give us a majority don't be,4241.07,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
1844,surprised if we then stop bread's that,4243.17,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
1845,but as I say we have led that campaign,4244.61,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
1846,for a people's vote and we with more,4246.86,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1847,liberal Democrat MPs in the next,4249.86,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1848,parliament will campaign for a people's,4251.36,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
1849,vote if we're not able to revoke room in,4253.43,6.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
1850,the orange top and yeah my question is,4255.74,8.58,8cQMzVjHBeI
1851,so if the me I'm a Romina I voted to,4259.78,9.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
1852,remain I would like people so but for me,4264.32,6.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
1853,the Liberal Democrats seem more,4269.06,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
1854,interested in just arguing with rather,4271.25,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
1855,than working collaborative in,4274.07,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1856,collaboration with other parties and the,4276.08,5.49,8cQMzVjHBeI
1857,politicians so I mean I don't see the,4277.64,5.66,8cQMzVjHBeI
1858,point,4281.57,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
1859,why aren't you ruled out a coalition,4283.3,4.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
1860,with Jeremy Corbyn of course was just,4286.19,2.97,8cQMzVjHBeI
1861,standing here just a few minutes ago,4287.36,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
1862,when they had promised a second,4289.16,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
1863,referendum they are surely your best,4291.38,6.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
1864,hope to remain well I mean Jeremy Corbyn,4293.84,5.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
1865,also stood here and said that he would,4297.59,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
1866,be neutral in that referendum so I don't,4299.75,3.66,8cQMzVjHBeI
1867,think that we and the millions of people,4301.46,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1868,who want to remain and this comes,4303.41,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
1869,you can trust Jeremy Corbyn on brexit,4304.76,3.959,8cQMzVjHBeI
1870,but the other exchange that you had,4306.92,3.299,8cQMzVjHBeI
1871,which I thought was a very powerful,4308.719,4.201,8cQMzVjHBeI
1872,exchange was about what happened in the,4310.219,4.261,8cQMzVjHBeI
1873,Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn in,4312.92,3.389,8cQMzVjHBeI
1874,terms of anti-semitism but they are,4314.48,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1875,being investigated by their quality and,4316.309,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
1876,human rights commission and he said he,4318.05,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
1877,was happy about that I don't think a,4319.519,3.571,8cQMzVjHBeI
1878,party leader should be happy about that,4321.44,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
1879,I think you should be ashamed about that,4323.09,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
1880,and I just don't think that we can,4324.65,6.659,8cQMzVjHBeI
1881,ignore the genuine fear that lots of,4326.96,6.929,8cQMzVjHBeI
1882,people feel about Jeremy Corbyn being,4331.309,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
1883,Prime Minister so when it comes to,4333.889,4.591,8cQMzVjHBeI
1884,working collaboratively absolutely and,4335.869,4.681,8cQMzVjHBeI
1885,what does that what does that mean let's,4338.48,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
1886,just look at what we've done over the,4340.55,5.31,8cQMzVjHBeI
1887,last couple of years right we are here,4343.01,6.12,8cQMzVjHBeI
1888,it is November we are still members of,4345.86,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
1889,the European Union and we were supposed,4349.13,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
1890,to leave in the 29th of March and we,4351.11,3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1891,were supposed to leave in the 31st of,4352.82,2.879,8cQMzVjHBeI
1892,October and for people that wanted to,4354.11,3.239,8cQMzVjHBeI
1893,leave if that was you then I appreciate,4355.699,3.121,8cQMzVjHBeI
1894,you're gonna be frustrated by that but,4357.349,3.241,8cQMzVjHBeI
1895,as a party that wanted to stop breaks it,4358.82,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
1896,you know we have worked collaboratively,4360.59,4.259,8cQMzVjHBeI
1897,to make that happen we've worked with,4362.3,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
1898,people in the labour party in the,4364.849,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
1899,Conservative Party in the SMP implied,4366.17,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1900,Kamri and the Greens we have worked,4368.389,4.411,8cQMzVjHBeI
1901,where we can reach out and we have,4370.34,5.129,8cQMzVjHBeI
1902,stopped breaks it twice just imagine if,4372.8,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
1903,you elect more Liberal Democrat MP s,4375.469,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1904,what we will be able to achieve and,4377.21,3.119,8cQMzVjHBeI
1905,we'll be able to stop breaks it for good,4378.769,2.881,8cQMzVjHBeI
1906,but there's a forest of hands aren't,4380.329,2.701,8cQMzVjHBeI
1907,going to go around a few people at once,4381.65,2.969,8cQMzVjHBeI
1908,if that's all right by you yes the woman,4383.03,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
1909,here in the black top I'm you're talking,4384.619,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
1910,a lot about working collaboratively with,4387.23,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
1911,other parties but your policy in the,4388.969,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1912,unlikely event that you were elected,4391.73,3.599,8cQMzVjHBeI
1913,prime minister with the majority you're,4393.139,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
1914,positive of a key article 50 is just as,4395.329,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
1915,divisive as the policies that are coming,4397.369,3.721,8cQMzVjHBeI
1916,out from the kind of hard Bret's a tears,4399.079,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
1917,how would you possibly imagine that,4401.09,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
1918,you'd be able to bring the country,4403.639,3.181,8cQMzVjHBeI
1919,together if you were elected and you,4404.51,10.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
1920,revoke to ask for 15 remain voter and by,4406.82,10.049,8cQMzVjHBeI
1921,constituency mother Valley they voted,4414.73,4.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
1922,strongly to leave how did you what would,4416.869,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
1923,you how would you bring communities like,4419.63,3.12,8cQMzVjHBeI
1924,that together one do you're going here,4421.219,4.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
1925,the man here in the blue shirt yes you I,4422.75,5.489,8cQMzVjHBeI
1926,hear you talk about concern for the poor,4425.869,4.411,8cQMzVjHBeI
1927,or the reason people are poorer because,4428.239,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
1928,of austerity which you support your,4430.28,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
1929,deputy leader recently said that he,4432.469,3.541,8cQMzVjHBeI
1930,wants the government to run a permanent,4434.48,3.389,8cQMzVjHBeI
1931,surplus which is essentially more,4436.01,2.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
1932,palatable way,4437.869,2.831,8cQMzVjHBeI
1933,same permanent austerity why should we,4438.66,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
1934,trust you not to further cripple our,4440.7,5.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
1935,public services and the man only Draper,4442.38,4.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
1936,apologized to students for the student,4447.53,5.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
1937,debt debacle we haven't said what you're,4450.21,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
1938,going to do for them so students who,4452.91,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
1939,live with 50 grams worth of debt the,4454.56,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
1940,pain interest and the time they start to,4456.33,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
1941,study when they can't possibly pay it,4458.55,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
1942,back they're paying over 6% in interest,4460.11,4.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
1943,when they lucky enough to get a job,4462.6,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
1944,we've created a generation of graduates,4464.28,5.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
1945,who are in persistent debt to the state,4467.31,5.58,8cQMzVjHBeI
1946,it just doesn't hang true so what are,4469.8,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
1947,you going to do for those people that,4472.89,3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1948,we've created a whole generation in,4474.18,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
1949,persistent debt it's a completely,4475.89,7.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
1950,different topic there so I absolutely,4478.47,9.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
1951,recognize that so many people feel that,4483.81,5.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
1952,this division that we have in their,4487.53,3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1953,country right now is really horrible,4489.24,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
1954,it's really uncomfortable right in this,4490.53,3.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
1955,in this room there's people who are,4492.51,3.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
1956,leave remain so on and I'm sure we all,4493.68,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
1957,feel uncomfortable about that and we,4496.14,4.44,8cQMzVjHBeI
1958,kind of crave for a long for a filling,4498.09,3.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
1959,where that isn't there,4500.58,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
1960,all of it says I don't think there's an,4501.93,5.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
1961,easy answer to this right in you know in,4504.09,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
1962,Scotland we've you know we've been,4507.15,2.97,8cQMzVjHBeI
1963,living with this now for eight years,4508.92,2.58,8cQMzVjHBeI
1964,because of the run-up to the,4510.12,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1965,independence referendum and and the,4511.5,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
1966,society is still very divided on on,4513.69,3.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
1967,those lines so I don't think there's a,4516.03,5.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
1968,quick fix but I do think that many of,4517.53,6.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
1969,the issues which people were unhappy,4521.79,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
1970,about that things don't things are too,4523.59,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
1971,tough that you know the economy doesn't,4526.35,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
1972,work well enough for people I genuinely,4528.21,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
1973,fear that those are gonna be made worse,4530.55,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
1974,by leaving the European Union there's,4532.14,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
1975,gonna be less money about I mean take,4534.27,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
1976,out the point about austerity you know,4536.22,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
1977,what this question is saying is that you,4538.83,3.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
1978,will make austerity worse but everything,4540.78,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
1979,a budget I'm actually but what my my,4541.98,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
1980,point is is that it's leaving the,4544.2,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
1981,European Union that is going to unleash,4546.33,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
1982,on stare austerity on our country,4547.74,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
1983,because we are going to be poorer people,4549.63,3.09,8cQMzVjHBeI
1984,are going to lose their jobs there will,4551.31,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
1985,be less money for our NHS and and it,4552.72,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
1986,will get and it will be worse whereas,4555.6,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
1987,whereas if we remain then we won't,4557.55,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
1988,actually have more money to spend to be,4559.47,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
1989,able to invest in our communities and in,4560.82,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
1990,resolving many of the issues that people,4562.98,5.07,8cQMzVjHBeI
1991,are unhappy about so you know that's why,4564.72,5.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
1992,I'm standing on that platform to say I,4568.05,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
1993,want things to be better,4570.57,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
1994,because I recognize that for too many,4572.25,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
1995,people it has been too hard and and just,4574.29,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
1996,in here in response to the point you,4577.5,3.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
1997,make look you know maintenance grants,4579.12,4.44,8cQMzVjHBeI
1998,were being cut and we've said that we,4581.13,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
1999,want to put those back because we want,4583.56,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
2000,to invest in those young people we want,4584.82,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
2001,to make sure that people kind of access,4587.1,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
2002,to to funding for lifelong learning at,4588.57,4.55,8cQMzVjHBeI
2003,different points throughout their lives,4591.45,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
2004,but I'm not going to stand here and,4593.12,4.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
2005,promise that we're going to you know,4595.47,3.57,8cQMzVjHBeI
2006,abolish tuition fees there's a lot of,4597.42,3.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
2007,numbers that are getting flown or thrown,4599.04,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
2008,around by by different parties in this,4600.6,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
2009,election and you know a lot of the stuff,4602.52,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
2010,sounds good but can it actually be,4604.47,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
2011,delivered do you actually in your heart,4606.99,3.75,8cQMzVjHBeI
2012,of hearts believe that those thumbs add,4608.49,4.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
2013,up when the IFS says that it's just not,4610.74,4.67,8cQMzVjHBeI
2014,credible when you look at the labor,4613.35,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
2015,manifesto so I'd rather be,4615.41,3.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
2016,straightforward and honest with people,4617.76,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
2017,and a Dra and I think they should pay,4619.32,3.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
2018,something but I just think that balance,4621.75,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
2019,is totally out of sync we need to help,4622.92,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
2020,these people it's not about not paying,4625.14,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
2021,anything as the labor government is,4627.18,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
2022,suggesting there needs to be a rebalance,4629.28,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
2023,so what is that rebalance yeah and and I,4631.38,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
2024,think we need to look at how we invest,4633.75,3.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
2025,and supporting particularly people from,4635.28,3.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
2026,low income is going into university to,4636.81,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
2027,get more people doing that but if we,4639.12,5.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
2028,really want to improve life chances the,4640.8,6.84,8cQMzVjHBeI
2029,best place to put that money is in the,4644.64,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
2030,early years and in schools that's how,4647.64,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
2031,you get that social mobility that's how,4649.23,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
2032,you give young people opportunities and,4651.54,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
2033,that's where the priority for our,4654.06,4.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
2034,spending is going it's to make sure that,4656.01,5.13,8cQMzVjHBeI
2035,we give our schools the money they need,4658.8,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
2036,I mean at the moment in schools right,4661.14,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
2037,you've got teachers being sacked you've,4663.15,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
2038,got some schools not opening all day on,4665.28,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
2039,a Friday you've got skills crowd funding,4668.07,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
2040,for Pritz sticks and exercise books but,4670.2,3.66,8cQMzVjHBeI
2041,if that doesn't tell you that our,4672.6,2.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
2042,schools are in dire need of more funding,4673.86,3.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
2043,what does okay let's take a question,4675.51,5.97,8cQMzVjHBeI
2044,from Aldous Everard where abouts are you,4677.16,11.7,8cQMzVjHBeI
2045,oh hi and I'm sure that the Liberal,4681.48,9.12,8cQMzVjHBeI
2046,Democrats feel as if you you must feel,4688.86,3.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
2047,like you're in a bit in between a rock,4690.6,6.3,8cQMzVjHBeI
2048,and a hard place at the moment but just,4692.49,5.88,8cQMzVjHBeI
2049,wondering would would your question,4696.9,5.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
2050,would your conscience be clear if the if,4698.37,6.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
2051,as a result of the,4702.15,7.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
2052,dividing the remain vote between labor,4705.09,7.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
2053,Semmy remain I know but we've got that,4709.91,7.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
2054,we've got that next referendum within if,4712.29,7.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
2055,you divide that remain boat with your,4717.69,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
2056,conscience be clear if the Tories,4719.4,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
2057,managed to get a majority as a result of,4721.38,10.95,8cQMzVjHBeI
2058,that if you vote for Boris Johnson he,4723.63,11.4,8cQMzVjHBeI
2059,will use that vote to put through his,4732.33,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
2060,hard breaks that deal if you vote for,4735.03,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
2061,Jeremy Corbyn he will use that vote to,4737.16,5.1,8cQMzVjHBeI
2062,negotiate a labor breaks it deal in this,4739.71,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
2063,election my conscience would not be,4742.26,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
2064,clear if I didn't make sure but right,4744.3,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
2065,across the country people have the,4746.97,5.34,8cQMzVjHBeI
2066,chance to vote for a remain party for a,4748.92,5.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
2067,candidate that wants to stop rigs it,4752.31,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
2068,because this might be the last chance,4754.68,5.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
2069,that we have to stop it oh I'll see your,4756.36,3.99,8cQMzVjHBeI
2070,question,4759.9,5.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
2071,I fully agree I am my you know I am a,4760.35,9.15,8cQMzVjHBeI
2072,remainer as well but I don't want this,4765.08,7.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
2073,country not to go out of I don't know I,4769.5,4.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
2074,would rather that we went out of Europe,4772.47,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
2075,than we we didn't have another,4774.41,3.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
2076,referendum we need to have another,4776.58,3.33,8cQMzVjHBeI
2077,referendum because we need to heal those,4777.93,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
2078,those wounds that have been caused by,4779.91,3.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
2079,the initial referendum which was so,4782.01,3.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
2080,poorly worked out and which which has,4783.63,3.78,8cQMzVjHBeI
2081,been incredibly divisive to the country,4785.64,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
2082,for everyone I'm can I can I just say,4787.41,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
2083,that you know obviously if there's more,4790.02,2.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
2084,Liberal Democrats in that next,4791.34,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
2085,Parliament then that gives us more power,4792.84,4.8,8cQMzVjHBeI
2086,to deliver that but we also need to make,4794.82,6.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
2087,sure to get there that we stopped Boris,4797.64,6.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
2088,Johnson getting a majority and it's,4801.33,5.1,8cQMzVjHBeI
2089,Liberal Democrats who are able to win,4804.36,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
2090,seats from Boris Johnson and the Tories,4806.43,4.2,8cQMzVjHBeI
2091,there's lots of places in the country,4808.92,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
2092,where that can happen from what we're,4810.63,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
2093,seeing is not the case that Jeremy,4813.33,2.94,8cQMzVjHBeI
2094,Corbyn the Labour Party are going to be,4814.92,2.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
2095,able to win seats from the Conservatives,4816.27,3.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
2096,and that's why voting Liberal Democrat,4817.77,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
2097,is the way to deprive Boris Johnson or,4819.51,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
2098,majority men in the red time you know,4821.19,4.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
2099,I've heard you this evening I'm trying,4824.4,3.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
2100,to defend your record on you vote and,4826.05,2.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
2101,then on the other hand you'll say how,4827.61,2.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
2102,you know you're against these horrible,4828.81,3.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
2103,Tory cuts and I really really can't,4830.34,3.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
2104,trust you and you've got one difficult,4831.87,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
2105,question and you immediately try to turn,4833.76,3.899,8cQMzVjHBeI
2106,it around to anti-semitism,4836.28,3.06,8cQMzVjHBeI
2107,Jeremy Corbyn has been fighting,4837.659,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
2108,anti-semitism and racism in all its form,4839.34,12.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
2109,since before you were born I recognize,4841.679,14.161,8cQMzVjHBeI
2110,that you genuinely believe that but let,4852.3,5.879,8cQMzVjHBeI
2111,me say from the people that I've spoken,4855.84,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
2112,to in the Labor Party when I speak to,4858.179,3.841,8cQMzVjHBeI
2113,Luciana Berger who joined the Liberal,4860.46,3.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
2114,Democrats when I speak to Louise Owlman,4862.02,3.96,8cQMzVjHBeI
2115,who felt that she had to leave the,4864.09,3.899,8cQMzVjHBeI
2116,Labour Party and when I speak to Jewish,4865.98,4.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
2117,people right across the country they do,4867.989,5.46,8cQMzVjHBeI
2118,not feel they do not feel like Jeremy,4870.63,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
2119,Corbyn is fighting racism and,4873.449,3.781,8cQMzVjHBeI
2120,anti-semitism in the labour party they,4875.01,4.53,8cQMzVjHBeI
2121,know what that feels like and I'm gonna,4877.23,4.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
2122,listen to them and trust them on this,4879.54,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
2123,issue let's take a questionnaire from,4882.09,6.299,8cQMzVjHBeI
2124,Magdalene Lake where's Magdalene are,4883.92,7.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
2125,they having voted a number of times for,4888.389,5.401,8cQMzVjHBeI
2126,fracking how can we be sure of your,4891.63,4.88,8cQMzVjHBeI
2127,commitment to halting climate change,4893.79,6.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
2128,well I'm against fracking so while ago,4896.51,7.74,8cQMzVjHBeI
2129,vote said against a ban on it in 2015 so,4900.33,5.869,8cQMzVjHBeI
2130,when we were in the coalition government,4904.25,5.469,8cQMzVjHBeI
2131,my Liberal Democratic colleague ed Davy,4906.199,5.861,8cQMzVjHBeI
2132,was the energy secretary and he put in,4909.719,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
2133,place very stringent regulation but it's,4912.06,5.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
2134,your duty now of course indeed um but as,4914.639,5.881,8cQMzVjHBeI
2135,a party things have moved on that was,4917.82,3.33,8cQMzVjHBeI
2136,four years ago,4920.52,2.94,8cQMzVjHBeI
2137,we are against fracking we want a ban on,4921.15,5.549,8cQMzVjHBeI
2138,fracking because the climate emergency,4923.46,6.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
2139,is such that we shouldn't be starting,4926.699,6.621,8cQMzVjHBeI
2140,new fossil fuel industries we need to be,4929.88,6.509,8cQMzVjHBeI
2141,changing the way that we produce our,4933.32,5.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
2142,energy the way that we heat our homes we,4936.389,4.411,8cQMzVjHBeI
2143,need to be getting the carbon out of our,4938.55,4.919,8cQMzVjHBeI
2144,everyday lives rapidly and that means no,4940.8,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
2145,new fossil fuel industries such as,4943.469,3.901,8cQMzVjHBeI
2146,fracking so you won't change your mind,4945.63,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
2147,again even you voted against it a ban on,4947.37,5.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
2148,it in 2015 you're now saying that you do,4950.13,3.6,8cQMzVjHBeI
2149,think it should be banned you're not,4952.8,2.189,8cQMzVjHBeI
2150,going to change your mind again I'm very,4953.73,5.64,8cQMzVjHBeI
2151,clear we would ban fracking all the,4954.989,6.811,8cQMzVjHBeI
2152,other policies that you have their labor,4959.37,6.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
2153,policies and you are going on the back,4961.8,6.089,8cQMzVjHBeI
2154,of what labor are doing you say that,4965.58,5.46,8cQMzVjHBeI
2155,you're do progressive politics policies,4967.889,5.731,8cQMzVjHBeI
2156,and like childcare and SureStart and all,4971.04,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
2157,that kind of stuff but you voted against,4973.62,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI
2158,it you voted against it in the when,4975.87,4.41,8cQMzVjHBeI
2159,you're in Tory government you,4978.63,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
2160,particularly you yourself have voted,4980.28,5.64,8cQMzVjHBeI
2161,against progressive politics and every,4982.98,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
2162,time you are asked about something you,4985.92,4.31,8cQMzVjHBeI
2163,attack labor and you pretend to be,4987.9,6.54,8cQMzVjHBeI
2164,somebody who is akin to labor in some of,4990.23,5.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
2165,those progressive policies well I don't,4994.44,4.14,8cQMzVjHBeI
2166,believe it I don't think that you have,4996.06,5.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
2167,progressive policies I don't think that,4998.58,5.61,8cQMzVjHBeI
2168,you have left-wing policies I think that,5001.28,5.34,8cQMzVjHBeI
2169,actually the Liberal Democrats are right,5004.19,7.22,8cQMzVjHBeI
2170,wing party and then do not get my vote,5006.62,4.79,8cQMzVjHBeI
2171,and if you support the Labor Party and,5018.64,5.17,8cQMzVjHBeI
2172,if you want socialism and and that's,5021.92,4.65,8cQMzVjHBeI
2173,your viewpoint then we're not a,5023.81,5.73,8cQMzVjHBeI
2174,socialist party I'm a liberal and it's,5026.57,7.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
2175,not some annex to the Labor Party it's a,5029.54,7.86,8cQMzVjHBeI
2176,liberal party we want an open and a fair,5034.43,5.04,8cQMzVjHBeI
2177,and inclusive country we're an,5037.4,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
2178,internationalist party that's why we,5039.47,4.23,8cQMzVjHBeI
2179,want to remain in the European Union and,5042.02,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
2180,stop breaks it because we believe that,5043.7,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
2181,you you get further you achieve more if,5045.5,4.739,8cQMzVjHBeI
2182,you work with your closest neighbors,5048.41,3.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
2183,that's what we are standing for that's,5050.239,4.141,8cQMzVjHBeI
2184,what our values are and sometimes we do,5052.31,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
2185,agree with the Labour Party but we are,5054.38,4.35,8cQMzVjHBeI
2186,not the Labour Party we are a different,5057.2,3.44,8cQMzVjHBeI
2187,party and that's why we're standing,5058.73,4.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
2188,separately we we stand on our own two,5060.64,4.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
2189,feet in this election the woman in right,5063.11,5.129,8cQMzVjHBeI
2190,at the back there hi yeah I just kind of,5065.51,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
2191,want to follow up about the whole,5068.239,3.301,8cQMzVjHBeI
2192,climate change because recently on this,5069.38,3.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
2193,week you said you would be okay with,5071.54,3.81,8cQMzVjHBeI
2194,using nuclear weapons can you please,5073.01,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
2195,clarify why you think that would be okay,5075.35,3.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
2196,and how is that going to protect the,5077.09,3.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
2197,planet,5078.53,2.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
2198,so we live in a really dangerous world I,5085.44,7.24,8cQMzVjHBeI
2199,think it feels like it feels like it is,5089.38,6.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
2200,a much more uncertain world than even a,5092.68,5.55,8cQMzVjHBeI
2201,few years ago when you have President,5096.25,4.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
2202,Trump in the White House with his,5098.23,7.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
2203,volatile decisions in geopolitics I,5100.5,8.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
2204,don't think this is the time to get rid,5105.48,6.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
2205,of our nuclear deterrent I think that we,5109.33,5.88,8cQMzVjHBeI
2206,need to keep our nuclear deterrent and,5112.3,6.66,8cQMzVjHBeI
2207,that it keeps us safe I do think the,5115.21,7.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
2208,best use for nuclear weapons is to use,5118.96,6.63,8cQMzVjHBeI
2209,them to negotiate away other nuclear,5122.23,5.46,8cQMzVjHBeI
2210,weapons and the UK should be playing a,5125.59,4.64,8cQMzVjHBeI
2211,leading role in all of those,5127.69,5.13,8cQMzVjHBeI
2212,international diplomatic discussions,5130.23,4.9,8cQMzVjHBeI
2213,about how do we create a world without,5132.82,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
2214,nuclear weapons because that is what we,5135.13,4.109,8cQMzVjHBeI
2215,want to see but we are not there and,5137.11,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
2216,while we are not there that I do not,5139.239,5.431,8cQMzVjHBeI
2217,want us to scrap our deterrent man in,5142,5.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
2218,the blue shirt you seem to be the party,5144.67,6,8cQMzVjHBeI
2219,of missed opportunity when you were in,5147.82,4.32,8cQMzVjHBeI
2220,coalition with the Conservatives you,5150.67,3.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
2221,fell to something doing a number of,5152.14,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
2222,things you'd now reverse when the,5153.85,5.16,8cQMzVjHBeI
2223,Conservatives were heavily in minority,5156.76,5.91,8cQMzVjHBeI
2224,in government just recently you failed,5159.01,8.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
2225,to put your pride to one side team up,5162.67,8.4,8cQMzVjHBeI

2329,got a mandate to go through with brexit,5436.88,4.739,8cQMzVjHBeI
2330,and because I don't think you can say,5439.55,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
2331,that this general election can be your,5441.619,3.781,8cQMzVjHBeI
2332,Monday when brexit is mixed in with,5443.03,4.439,8cQMzVjHBeI
2333,health care and climate change and,5445.4,9.38,8cQMzVjHBeI
2334,education why are we having this,5447.469,10.38,8cQMzVjHBeI

2338,on your on your point about the the,5462.32,5.37,8cQMzVjHBeI
2339,reasons for having the election let's be,5465.38,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
2340,in no doubt I didn't want to have an,5467.69,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
2341,election now and no Prime Minister wants,5469.25,5.099,8cQMzVjHBeI
2342,an election on December the 12th we have,5471.71,5.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
2343,to do it because Parliament is blocking,5474.349,8.971,8cQMzVjHBeI
2344,brexit and voted to accept a reading of,5477.23,8.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
2345,your bill they then didn't want to do it,5483.32,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
2346,in just three days,5485.75,2.579,8cQMzVjHBeI
2347,they put well they were given every,5486.59,6.72,8cQMzVjHBeI
2348,opportunity to pass it pass it and they,5488.329,8.491,8cQMzVjHBeI
2349,passed a law to insist that we extended,5493.31,7.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
2350,beyond October the 31st and what we have,5496.82,5.43,8cQMzVjHBeI
2351,now is a situation in which the other,5500.42,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
2352,three party leaders either want to block,5502.25,4.829,8cQMzVjHBeI
2353,brexit or absurdly I want to have a,5504.53,5.49,8cQMzVjHBeI
2354,second referendum on the EU without and,5507.079,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
2355,that's i think mr corbyn's,5510.02,4.709,8cQMzVjHBeI
2356,it seems to mutate it tonight he's not,5511.339,4.89,8cQMzVjHBeI
2357,he now once he's now going to be neutral,5514.729,4.29,8cQMzVjHBeI
2358,on the deal that he proposes to do I,5516.229,4.5,8cQMzVjHBeI
2359,don't see how he can do a deal when he's,5519.019,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
2360,going to be effective the deal that he,5520.729,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
2361,wants to do never mind that,5523.729,4.47,8cQMzVjHBeI
2362,I do not think whatever deal mr. Corbyn,5525.349,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
2363,professor I don't think it's sensible,5528.199,4.44,8cQMzVjHBeI
2364,for this great country of ours to spend,5529.459,5.6,8cQMzVjHBeI

2378,three minutes to get that that phrase it,5563.3,2.699,8cQMzVjHBeI

2632,fine-tooth comb you can and take out,6231.11,4.259,8cQMzVjHBeI
2633,individual phrases there is no doubt,6233.42,4.469,8cQMzVjHBeI
2634,that you can find things that can be,6235.369,5.31,8cQMzVjHBeI
2635,made to seem offensive and of course and,6237.889,5.281,8cQMzVjHBeI
2636,I understand that I understand that but,6240.679,4.651,8cQMzVjHBeI
2637,what I will say just don't just on the,6243.17,5.19,8cQMzVjHBeI
2638,in just on that on the the point of that,6245.33,5.579,8cQMzVjHBeI

2640,olive was referring to I defend my right,6250.909,6.901,8cQMzVjHBeI
2641,to to speak out and I defend I do defend,6254.929,6.181,8cQMzVjHBeI
2642,my right to and if you actually read the,6257.81,4.619,8cQMzVjHBeI
2643,piece which I don't know how many people,6261.11,3.33,8cQMzVjHBeI
2644,have if you read the piece what I was,6262.429,5.401,8cQMzVjHBeI
2645,really doing I suggest you read any of,6264.44,6.989,8cQMzVjHBeI
2646,them all of them what I was really what,6267.83,6.599,8cQMzVjHBeI
2647,I was really doing was mounting a strong,6271.429,6.511,8cQMzVjHBeI
2648,liberal defense of the right of women in,6274.429,6.21,8cQMzVjHBeI
2649,this country to wear what they choose,6277.94,5.219,8cQMzVjHBeI
2650,and I think most people and not to be,6280.639,4.261,8cQMzVjHBeI
2651,oppressed into wearing something they,6283.159,3.571,8cQMzVjHBeI
2652,don't want to wear and I think most,6284.9,3.33,8cQMzVjHBeI
2653,people in this country would agree with,6286.73,1.889,8cQMzVjHBeI
2654,that,6288.23,2.25,8cQMzVjHBeI
2655,so all is I think you're going to if,6288.619,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
2656,you'll say I'm sorry but well I think,6290.48,5.67,8cQMzVjHBeI
2657,you know I've just got to get back to my,6293.179,5.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
2658,my fundamental point I think that I've,6296.15,4.71,8cQMzVjHBeI
2659,I've always stood up,6298.699,5.701,8cQMzVjHBeI

2673,it and some women so let's hear from my,6332.119,4.921,8cQMzVjHBeI
2674,questions about the NHS but I just like,6335.42,5.489,8cQMzVjHBeI
2675,to back up on this point you just talked,6337.04,5.909,8cQMzVjHBeI
2676,about defending the freedoms of women,6340.909,5.79,8cQMzVjHBeI
2677,and you don't do that by taking down a,6342.949,5.52,8cQMzVjHBeI
2678,religious minority you don't do that by,6346.699,4.02,8cQMzVjHBeI
2679,offending Muslim women that's not how,6348.469,10.44,8cQMzVjHBeI

2684,there's a question here and the way that,6364.61,8.37,8cQMzVjHBeI
2685,you've spoken about race in the past is,6371.179,3.781,8cQMzVjHBeI
2686,completely characteristic of the way,6372.98,3.719,8cQMzVjHBeI
2687,your government has dealt with all the,6374.96,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
2688,issues that's come up across since 2010,6376.699,3.48,8cQMzVjHBeI
2689,it's been characterized by complete,6378.35,4.11,8cQMzVjHBeI
2690,carelessness by callousness the way you,6380.179,4.531,8cQMzVjHBeI
2691,treat people through the DWP where,6382.46,3.779,8cQMzVjHBeI
2692,you've treated the victims of rain fell,6384.71,3.87,8cQMzVjHBeI
2693,the hostile environment it's like it's,6386.239,4.801,8cQMzVjHBeI

2695,hospitals and you've spoken to public,6391.04,3.929,8cQMzVjHBeI
2696,service workers but I think you yourself,6392.6,3.45,8cQMzVjHBeI
2697,know you haven't been welcomed when,6394.969,2.611,8cQMzVjHBeI
2698,you've been to speak to them the way,6396.05,2.7,8cQMzVjHBeI
2699,you've conducted yourself when you've,6397.58,2.49,8cQMzVjHBeI
2700,been there is shown that you're afraid,6398.75,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI
2701,of the response you're going to get so I,6400.07,3.69,8cQMzVjHBeI
2702,think it's I think it's insulting to the,6402.02,2.82,8cQMzVjHBeI
2703,people who've suffered under your,6403.76,3.03,8cQMzVjHBeI

2706,days you've been part of the government,6408.71,3.029,8cQMzVjHBeI
2707,for the last nine years I think it's,6410.06,4.139,8cQMzVjHBeI
2708,completely insulting for you for you to,6411.739,3.661,8cQMzVjHBeI
2709,stand there and talk about all the,6414.199,2.67,8cQMzVjHBeI
2710,investment you're going to bring when,6415.4,3.27,8cQMzVjHBeI

2816,condition it's as much about the,6677.42,3.03,8cQMzVjHBeI
2817,conditions as it is about the money yeah,6678.5,5.01,8cQMzVjHBeI

2826,this and they think do I want to stay in,6696.81,3.51,8cQMzVjHBeI
2827,England we've invested hundreds of,6698.67,2.76,8cQMzVjHBeI
2828,thousands of pounds in their training,6700.32,3.09,8cQMzVjHBeI

2835,they don't have a political football,6713.49,3.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
2836,they don't they don't get treated like a,6714.9,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
2837,political or we need to look at the,6716.67,4.08,8cQMzVjHBeI
2838,conditions as well as the money that's,6718.83,12.42,8cQMzVjHBeI
2839,been invested by massively the work that,6720.75,13.77,8cQMzVjHBeI
2840,all the staff doing the in the NHS and I,6731.25,5.19,8cQMzVjHBeI
2841,I have to say I think your point is,6734.52,3.93,8cQMzVjHBeI
2842,right and many doctors many senior,6736.44,3.39,8cQMzVjHBeI
2843,doctors have made the point to me in,6738.45,2.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
2844,particular about their their pension,6739.83,4.05,8cQMzVjHBeI
2845,arrangements and where we're trying to,6741.3,4.68,8cQMzVjHBeI
2846,address that we just taken further steps,6743.88,5.28,8cQMzVjHBeI
2847,to address that this year and III know,6745.98,6.09,8cQMzVjHBeI
2848,that the the problem that the doctors,6749.16,5.58,8cQMzVjHBeI
2849,face but we're also recruiting huge,6752.07,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
2850,numbers I just say sincerely to people,6754.74,4.26,8cQMzVjHBeI
2851,the only way we can do this is by having,6756.66,6,8cQMzVjHBeI
2852,a strong economy and I'm afraid to say,6759,5.31,8cQMzVjHBeI
2853,and and that is throughout the economy,6762.66,4.83,8cQMzVjHBeI
2854,has grown every year for the last nine,6764.31,5.49,8cQMzVjHBeI
2855,years it's now 20 percent bigger than it,6767.49,4.56,8cQMzVjHBeI
2856,was and when Labour left office last,6769.8,4.62,8cQMzVjHBeI
2857,time as with every departing Labor,6772.05,4.92,8cQMzVjHBeI
2858,government they left and economic,6774.42,4.59,8cQMzVjHBeI
2859,shambles and if you look at what is,6776.97,3.54,8cQMzVjHBeI

2941,can only meet that demand we can only,6969.35,5.18,8cQMzVjHBeI
2942,meet that demand if we have a dynamic,6971.96,5.85,8cQMzVjHBeI
