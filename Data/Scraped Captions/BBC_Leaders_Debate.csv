105,election or are they just a couple of,280.38,6.99,sbE-emYnHJk
106,old has-been so the question of mr.,283.59,5.43,sbE-emYnHJk
107,Purcell is referring to the fact that,287.37,4.68,sbE-emYnHJk
108,both John Major your former leader and,289.02,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
109,Tony Blair your film a leader have,292.05,4.08,sbE-emYnHJk

117,to deprecating boys as I have been but I,312.39,6.27,sbE-emYnHJk
118,don't think he's right and we have a,316.59,5.31,sbE-emYnHJk
119,fantastic plan to get brexit done it's a,318.66,4.74,sbE-emYnHJk
120,deal that's ready to go it's Aven ready,321.9,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
121,we can get it done by Christmas getting,323.4,4.02,sbE-emYnHJk
122,back into Parliament by Christmas if we,326.13,3.36,sbE-emYnHJk
123,have a majority Conservative government,327.42,6.96,sbE-emYnHJk
124,and all I mean unlike mr. major I lead a,329.49,8.19,sbE-emYnHJk
125,party that is now totally united all 630,334.38,4.95,sbE-emYnHJk
126,plus conservative candidates at this,337.68,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk

131,spectrum of views in there in our party,346.38,3.93,sbE-emYnHJk
132,but they all back our deal now the,348.75,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
133,mystery is what is the position of the,350.31,4.8,sbE-emYnHJk
134,leader of the Opposition on this subject,353.01,4.44,sbE-emYnHJk
135,because I have yet to hear what the deal,355.11,4.05,sbE-emYnHJk

137,he backs it himself Jeremy Corbyn the,359.16,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
138,question was should you be worried about,361.32,4.02,sbE-emYnHJk

143,this level of inequality of poverty,371.85,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
144,amongst our children of underfunding of,374.13,3.27,sbE-emYnHJk
145,our schools and a threat to our national,375.81,5.04,sbE-emYnHJk
146,health service and a no deal brexit,377.4,4.8,sbE-emYnHJk
147,which the Prime Minister is threatening,380.85,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
148,us with or a trade deal with Donald,382.2,4.2,sbE-emYnHJk
149,Trump in the USA which will damage our,384.72,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
150,public services a vote for labor is a,386.4,4.44,sbE-emYnHJk
151,vote to end austerity a vote for labor,389.01,3.75,sbE-emYnHJk

154,are welcome to make the comments that,395.55,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
155,they do I urge them to think for a,397.44,4.62,sbE-emYnHJk
156,moment think for a moment at the reality,399.51,4.5,sbE-emYnHJk
157,of what nine years of austerity is done,402.06,3.54,sbE-emYnHJk

166,have been denied it during these years,421.92,3.63,sbE-emYnHJk
167,of austerities and the truth that many,423.72,3.24,sbE-emYnHJk
168,voters think there's an impossible,425.55,2.96,sbE-emYnHJk
169,choice that either,426.96,3.71,sbE-emYnHJk
170,number 10 Downing Street well I hope,428.51,3.6,sbE-emYnHJk

172,one nation conservative government and,432.11,3.75,sbE-emYnHJk

175,positive it's progressive it will unite,437.63,4.56,sbE-emYnHJk

179,government will not leave anybody behind,446.96,5.22,sbE-emYnHJk
180,that is the whole principle the golden,449.48,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
181,thread that runs through our manifesto,452.18,2.73,sbE-emYnHJk
182,well let's turn to brexit it's already,453.59,3.24,sbE-emYnHJk
183,been raised many times already and on,454.91,4.35,sbE-emYnHJk
184,this question we're going to take two,456.83,5.97,sbE-emYnHJk
185,questions one from a leave voter one,459.26,6.21,sbE-emYnHJk
186,from a remain voter so first of all Evol,462.8,5.82,sbE-emYnHJk
187,Nemeton who voted Li's please brick Fiat,465.47,5.33,sbE-emYnHJk
188,has taken up so much time already,468.62,5.16,sbE-emYnHJk
189,people are really fed up can you,470.8,5.41,sbE-emYnHJk
190,guarantee that it will happen next year,473.78,4.14,sbE-emYnHJk

192,and then Tom Clark who voted remain how,477.92,5.82,sbE-emYnHJk
193,would we be better off from the brexit,481.91,4.8,sbE-emYnHJk
194,deal or a future labor deal compared to,483.74,4.47,sbE-emYnHJk
195,what we already have as a member of the,486.71,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
196,EU thank you very much let's turn first,488.21,5.52,sbE-emYnHJk
197,to Yvonne Emerson's question can you,490.97,5.97,sbE-emYnHJk
198,guarantee that brexit will happen next,493.73,5.91,sbE-emYnHJk
199,year jeremy corbyn well I can guarantee,496.94,4.68,sbE-emYnHJk
200,is that will bring an end to this debate,499.64,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
201,and we will have a final say for the,501.62,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
202,people of this country we cannot go on,503.6,5.79,sbE-emYnHJk
203,forever saying we represent the 48 or,505.58,6.09,sbE-emYnHJk
204,the 52 I want to lead a government that,509.39,4.589,sbE-emYnHJk
205,represents the whole country and the,511.67,4.559,sbE-emYnHJk
206,whole community so we will within three,513.979,5.011,sbE-emYnHJk
207,months negotiate a leave agreement with,516.229,4.291,sbE-emYnHJk
208,the European Union that will protect,518.99,4.59,sbE-emYnHJk
209,trade and jobs and the peace process in,520.52,5.31,sbE-emYnHJk
210,Northern Ireland and put that alongside,523.58,4.68,sbE-emYnHJk
211,remain in a referendum within six months,525.83,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
212,and that will be the end of the matter,528.26,4.56,sbE-emYnHJk
213,my role as the leader of my party as the,530,5.19,sbE-emYnHJk
214,Prime Minister would be to ensure that,532.82,5.28,sbE-emYnHJk
215,decision is carried out whatever it is,535.19,5.85,sbE-emYnHJk
216,but nobody voted to lose their job or to,538.1,5.67,sbE-emYnHJk
217,lose trade with Europe people voted for,541.04,4.74,sbE-emYnHJk
218,many many reasons but I think we've got,543.77,3.93,sbE-emYnHJk
219,to come together and bring this issue to,545.78,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
220,an end not go down the road of,547.7,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
221,sweetheart deals with the USA Boris,549.77,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
222,Johnson well I sure the frustration of,551.87,4.5,sbE-emYnHJk
223,both our questions about the length of,554.75,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
224,time it's taken to get brexit done and,556.37,4.77,sbE-emYnHJk
225,what we can do with the deal that we,558.98,2.73,sbE-emYnHJk
226,have is,561.14,3,sbE-emYnHJk
227,done by January the 31st and come out,561.71,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
228,and then to get to the question about,564.14,4.2,sbE-emYnHJk
229,the advantages we can do such things as,565.94,4.14,sbE-emYnHJk
230,improve our standards for animal welfare,568.34,3.75,sbE-emYnHJk
231,banned the live export of animals we can,570.08,5.49,sbE-emYnHJk
232,cut the eighty on tampons we can do,572.09,5.16,sbE-emYnHJk
233,things to create free ports around the,575.57,3.84,sbE-emYnHJk
234,country there are all sorts of ways in,577.25,3.84,sbE-emYnHJk
235,which we can regulate differently in,579.41,3.72,sbE-emYnHJk
236,better we can also of course control our,581.09,4.14,sbE-emYnHJk
237,immigration system for the first time in,583.13,4.05,sbE-emYnHJk
238,long time now well I haven't heard from,585.23,4.35,sbE-emYnHJk
239,the leader of the Labour Party's this,587.18,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
240,deal that he thinks he can get in three,589.58,4.68,sbE-emYnHJk
241,months time who is going to negotiate it,591.47,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
242,because as far as I can see everybody on,594.26,5.22,sbE-emYnHJk
243,the labor front bench is campaigning to,596.45,6.06,sbE-emYnHJk
244,remain apart from mr. Corbyn who's who,599.48,5.28,sbE-emYnHJk
245,is neutral on the matter who is going to,602.51,5.25,sbE-emYnHJk
246,secure this deal how can you get a deal,604.76,5.55,sbE-emYnHJk
247,a new deal from Brussels for brexit if,607.76,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
248,you don't actually believe in it that's,610.31,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
249,the mystery that I've felt well jeremy,612.17,3.9,sbE-emYnHJk
250,corbyn i don't you go to dearly asked if,614.6,3.54,sbE-emYnHJk
251,you don't really believe in it and john,616.07,4.05,sbE-emYnHJk
252,macdonald and Diane Abbott and kissed on,618.14,3.63,sbE-emYnHJk
253,all the rest week they say they remain,620.12,4.71,sbE-emYnHJk
254,we get a deal in order to ensure that,621.77,5.91,sbE-emYnHJk
255,whatever the outcome of final vote the,624.83,5.16,sbE-emYnHJk
256,trade relationship continues with Europe,627.68,4.59,sbE-emYnHJk
257,if you go down the road it'll take seven,629.99,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
258,years to negotiate a trade deal with the,632.27,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
259,USA you're gonna have queues all up the,633.98,5.04,sbE-emYnHJk
260,m20 in Kent you're going to have a,636.53,4.92,sbE-emYnHJk
261,problem of supply chain to all of our,639.02,4.65,sbE-emYnHJk
262,manufacturing industries you're going to,641.45,5.54,sbE-emYnHJk
263,have job losses on a huge scale nonsense,643.67,5.94,sbE-emYnHJk
264,unless you have a serious deal with the,646.99,5.02,sbE-emYnHJk
265,EU to maintain that trade relationship,649.61,4.14,sbE-emYnHJk
266,we have a deal it's a wonderful deal,652.01,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
267,we're coming out on January the 31st if,653.75,5.25,sbE-emYnHJk
268,we can get a working majority and I'm,656.39,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
269,afraid listening to mr. Korbell it's,659,4.35,sbE-emYnHJk
270,absolutely clear that what would happen,660.8,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
271,next years would be a period of,663.35,3.54,sbE-emYnHJk
272,negotiation about this mystery deal led,664.91,3.9,sbE-emYnHJk
273,by somebody in the labour party that was,666.89,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
274,we can't yet identify since mr. korman,668.81,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
275,doesn't believe in the deal himself it,671.18,4.65,sbE-emYnHJk
276,would then be put to another referendum,673.07,4.86,sbE-emYnHJk
277,to the people of this country Parliament,675.83,4.73,sbE-emYnHJk
278,our country would spend a whole year,677.93,7.47,sbE-emYnHJk
279,more probably more Oh wracked locked in,680.56,6.22,sbE-emYnHJk
280,debate about brexit,685.4,3.54,sbE-emYnHJk
281,when what people want to do is move on,686.78,4.35,sbE-emYnHJk
282,and focus on the issues facing the,688.94,3.78,sbE-emYnHJk
283,people jeremy corbyn and then what we,691.13,3.72,sbE-emYnHJk
284,can do immediate mr. Johnson will spend,692.72,2.62,sbE-emYnHJk
285,at least,694.85,2.74,sbE-emYnHJk
286,seven years negotiating the USA on,695.34,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
287,access to our public services on the,697.59,3.84,sbE-emYnHJk
288,price of medicines in Britain on the,699.75,3.09,sbE-emYnHJk
289,access to our national health service,701.43,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
290,and he knows he can't get a deal quickly,702.84,4.8,sbE-emYnHJk
291,with the USA because of the way in which,705.75,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
292,the US political system works and so,707.64,3.9,sbE-emYnHJk
293,what he will do is walk out of a,709.86,3.27,sbE-emYnHJk
294,relationship with the EU into a,711.54,3.93,sbE-emYnHJk
295,relationship with nobody and that is,713.13,6.3,sbE-emYnHJk
296,where the chaos will come I'm afraid,715.47,6.63,sbE-emYnHJk
297,that shows a slightly groups of the of,719.43,4.68,sbE-emYnHJk
298,the reality which is that as we leave,722.1,4.71,sbE-emYnHJk
299,the EU we are coming out with our deal,724.11,5.64,sbE-emYnHJk
300,with a state of perfect equivalence zero,726.81,5.07,sbE-emYnHJk
301,tariffs zero quota will be able to begin,729.75,4.35,sbE-emYnHJk
302,not only putting in our Australian star,731.88,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
303,points based system for immigration,734.1,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
304,taking back control of our laws taking,736.11,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
305,back control of our money will also be,738.48,3.12,sbE-emYnHJk
306,asked your matter trade there mister,740.22,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
307,John talks not just with countries,741.6,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk

310,you again and again so the phrase get,750.08,4.45,sbE-emYnHJk
311,brexit dark that's right but you haven't,752.7,4.02,sbE-emYnHJk
312,done a trade deal with the EU you don't,754.53,4.02,sbE-emYnHJk
313,know you could do a trade deal with EU,756.72,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
314,you don't know there won't be no deal on,758.55,5.07,sbE-emYnHJk
315,trade with the EU do you on the country,760.68,5.55,sbE-emYnHJk
316,we have a fantastic deal it is there,763.62,5.37,sbE-emYnHJk
317,ready to go and trade forgive me you,766.23,4.8,sbE-emYnHJk
318,don't have what it has what it what our,768.99,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
319,deal allows is for British businesses of,771.03,5.61,sbE-emYnHJk
320,all kinds to have perfect confidence in,773.88,5.07,sbE-emYnHJk
321,the way we leave the EU because we are,776.64,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
322,in the state of equivalence with zero,778.95,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
323,tariffs zero quota exact a regulatory,780.75,6.93,sbE-emYnHJk
324,framework and we have ample time to get,783.84,5.7,sbE-emYnHJk
325,on and build a new free trade,787.68,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
326,partnership not just with the EU but,789.54,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
327,with countries around the world and the,792,3.9,sbE-emYnHJk
328,great beauty of this deal is it it gets,793.8,4.92,sbE-emYnHJk
329,brexit done gets it out of Parliament,795.9,5.01,sbE-emYnHJk
330,stops the ranked wrangling stops the,798.72,3.81,sbE-emYnHJk
331,chaos and moves us for thank you very,800.91,3.72,sbE-emYnHJk
332,much Jeremy Jeremy Corbyn jeremy,802.53,5.13,sbE-emYnHJk
333,corbyn's gonna spend years negotiating,804.63,5.07,sbE-emYnHJk
334,with the USA he's gonna spend years,807.66,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
335,ruing the fact he didn't reach a proper,809.7,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
336,agreeing with the EU before leaving and,811.65,3.8,sbE-emYnHJk
337,as the documents we've shown today,813.93,3.56,sbE-emYnHJk
338,indicate he hasn't been exactly,815.45,3.91,sbE-emYnHJk
339,straightforward on the issues,817.49,4.18,sbE-emYnHJk
340,surrounding trade with Northern Ireland,819.36,4.8,sbE-emYnHJk
341,and the Republic of Ireland and so I do,821.67,4.74,sbE-emYnHJk
342,think we need a bit of openness from the,824.16,3.9,sbE-emYnHJk
343,government we forced him to release the,826.41,2.26,sbE-emYnHJk
344,documents,828.06,1.93,sbE-emYnHJk
345,so we've released them for them actually,828.67,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
346,a week ago which showed the access that,829.99,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
347,the us were demanding to our public,832.54,4.59,sbE-emYnHJk
348,services and today the news came out of,834.31,4.47,sbE-emYnHJk
349,what's happening with Northern Ireland,837.13,3.12,sbE-emYnHJk
350,and briefly mr. Gordon for people who,838.78,2.43,sbE-emYnHJk
351,didn't hear the news what are you,840.25,2.52,sbE-emYnHJk
352,claiming the documents show and then,841.21,2.67,sbE-emYnHJk
353,we'll put it to play show quite clearly,842.77,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
354,that there are going to be charges there,843.88,4.83,sbE-emYnHJk
355,are going to be customs checks that are,846.73,3.42,sbE-emYnHJk
356,going to be restrictions on trade,848.71,4.08,sbE-emYnHJk
357,between Britain and Northern Ireland,850.15,3.84,sbE-emYnHJk
358,thank you very much first John so,852.79,3.42,sbE-emYnHJk
359,actually that is not true the whole of,853.99,5.61,sbE-emYnHJk
360,the UK comes out England Scotland Wales,856.21,5.34,sbE-emYnHJk
361,Northern Ireland together we do free,859.6,3.84,sbE-emYnHJk
362,trade deals together Northern Ireland is,861.55,3.42,sbE-emYnHJk
363,part of the customs territory of the of,863.44,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
364,the UK and we are united and I have to,864.97,7.44,sbE-emYnHJk
365,say I I think it's relevant and it says,867.7,6.54,sbE-emYnHJk
366,unfettered access I think is what it,872.41,15.35,sbE-emYnHJk
367,says is part of the customs territory,874.24,13.52,sbE-emYnHJk
368,the Union is who were your partners they,888,3.73,sbE-emYnHJk
369,agree with him I'm not usually don't,890.41,3.24,sbE-emYnHJk
370,actually because because our deal is a,891.73,3.39,sbE-emYnHJk
371,great deal you know let me just make one,893.65,3.48,sbE-emYnHJk
372,one part I do find it slightly curious,895.12,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
373,to say the least neck to be lectured,897.13,3.42,sbE-emYnHJk
374,about the union between Great Britain,899.08,3.9,sbE-emYnHJk
375,and Northern Ireland by a man who all,900.55,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
376,his life political life has campaigned,902.98,3.51,sbE-emYnHJk
377,to break up that Union and actually,904.93,4.8,sbE-emYnHJk
378,supported for four decades the IRA in,906.49,6.63,sbE-emYnHJk
379,their campaign by violently violently to,909.73,5.28,sbE-emYnHJk
380,destroy I must say I find it a curiosity,913.12,4.14,sbE-emYnHJk
381,Jeremy Corbyn wasn't about the Prime,915.01,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
382,Minister showing a degree of honesty,917.26,3.84,sbE-emYnHJk
383,about the arrangements he's actually,919.27,3.93,sbE-emYnHJk
384,made with Northern Ireland he spoke at,921.1,3.6,sbE-emYnHJk
385,DUP conferences said there would be no,923.2,3.51,sbE-emYnHJk
386,restrictions whatsoever we now know,924.7,3.93,sbE-emYnHJk
387,there are restrictions he should and,926.71,4.56,sbE-emYnHJk
388,could have said that at the time and so,928.63,5.34,sbE-emYnHJk
389,it is a question of openness on all of,931.27,4.94,sbE-emYnHJk
390,this when he says you've supported,933.97,4.65,sbE-emYnHJk
391,people who are opposed to you need your,936.21,3.85,sbE-emYnHJk
392,whole life you don't even believe what,938.62,3.54,sbE-emYnHJk
393,I've done is always wanted to see a,940.06,3.81,sbE-emYnHJk
394,peace process in Northern Ireland and,942.16,3.63,sbE-emYnHJk
395,that is exactly what we've got and thank,943.87,3,sbE-emYnHJk
396,you to the Labour government that,945.79,2.79,sbE-emYnHJk
397,negotiated it after night now gentlemen,946.87,4.83,sbE-emYnHJk
398,briefly thank you there was a second,948.58,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
399,question I want to give you the chance,951.7,2.82,sbE-emYnHJk
400,if you remember let me just remind you,952.81,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
401,Tom Clark asked you mr. Johnson how,954.52,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
402,we'll be better off from the brexit deal,956.77,4.47,sbE-emYnHJk
403,or a future labor deal compared to,959.5,3.689,sbE-emYnHJk
404,being in the EU please thank you thanks,961.24,3.539,sbE-emYnHJk
405,very much Tom endure there will be all,963.189,4.531,sbE-emYnHJk
406,sorts of ways I've mentioned the the,964.779,5.821,sbE-emYnHJk
407,ways we can cut dat on sanitary products,967.72,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
408,or regulate differently for bioscience,970.6,5.849,sbE-emYnHJk
409,or do have free ports in areas that need,972.61,5.61,sbE-emYnHJk
410,investment you can trigger growth and,976.449,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
411,investments in some of the Left Behind,978.22,5.369,sbE-emYnHJk
412,coastal communities by having three,980.769,4.651,sbE-emYnHJk
413,Porter's 130 countries do around the,983.589,4.131,sbE-emYnHJk
414,world we can't because of EU rules,985.42,5.699,sbE-emYnHJk
415,another major advantage is of course,987.72,4.929,sbE-emYnHJk
416,that we take back control of a lot of,991.119,3.39,sbE-emYnHJk
417,money that we'd out otherwise sent to,992.649,4.35,sbE-emYnHJk
418,the EU but I might mention also our,994.509,4.77,sbE-emYnHJk
419,ability to control our immigration which,996.999,4.68,sbE-emYnHJk
420,is not unimportant I'm a believer in,999.279,4.381,sbE-emYnHJk
421,immigration for people of talent who,1001.679,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
422,want to come here fantastic but we've,1003.66,3.179,sbE-emYnHJk
423,got to control it thank you,1005.369,3.66,sbE-emYnHJk
424,democratically Janko in your answer the,1006.839,4.831,sbE-emYnHJk
425,Russians to do forgive me how will we be,1009.029,4.771,sbE-emYnHJk
426,better off from brexit you're asked if,1011.67,6.449,sbE-emYnHJk
427,you have your deal or indeed and you go,1013.8,5.879,sbE-emYnHJk
428,to a referendum and it passes and we do,1018.119,4.02,sbE-emYnHJk
429,leave because we will make sure that our,1019.679,4.77,sbE-emYnHJk
430,jobs and our manufacturing industries,1022.139,4.831,sbE-emYnHJk
431,are able to continue trading over half,1024.449,4.021,sbE-emYnHJk
432,of our traders with Europe at the,1026.97,4.619,sbE-emYnHJk
433,present time walk away from that put up,1028.47,5.04,sbE-emYnHJk
434,a barrier on that then you've got real,1031.589,4.08,sbE-emYnHJk
435,problems for manufacturing industry jobs,1033.51,3.21,sbE-emYnHJk
436,all across the country,1035.669,3.51,sbE-emYnHJk
437,many jobs have already been lost because,1036.72,4.739,sbE-emYnHJk
438,of the uncertainty surrounding all this,1039.179,4.201,sbE-emYnHJk
439,we gotta deal with destitute in six,1041.459,3.72,sbE-emYnHJk
440,months the Prime Minister's suggestions,1043.38,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
441,of a trade deal with the USA which will,1045.179,4.771,sbE-emYnHJk
442,take at least in their estimation seven,1047.49,4.77,sbE-emYnHJk
443,years to negotiate means seven years of,1049.95,4.8,sbE-emYnHJk
444,complete uncertainty and continued job,1052.26,4.2,sbE-emYnHJk
445,losses in manufacturing industry we go,1054.75,3.09,sbE-emYnHJk
446,when you've been asked by Boris Johnson,1056.46,2.61,sbE-emYnHJk
447,I want to give you the chance to answer,1057.84,3.42,sbE-emYnHJk
448,why you won't say where you stand on,1059.07,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
449,Britta is it that you don't know what,1061.26,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
450,you think about brexit or that you do,1063.33,4.229,sbE-emYnHJk
451,know but you won't help it's because I,1065.52,3.84,sbE-emYnHJk
452,think the country has to come together,1067.559,4.141,sbE-emYnHJk
453,and cannot keep on negotiating and,1069.36,5.97,sbE-emYnHJk
454,arguing with itself about 48 vs. 52 it,1071.7,6.03,sbE-emYnHJk
455,has to be an agreement we can reach with,1075.33,4.319,sbE-emYnHJk
456,the EU that is credible and would,1077.73,3.66,sbE-emYnHJk
457,maintain that trade relationship but,1079.649,4.321,sbE-emYnHJk
458,would be outside of EU membership or,1081.39,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
459,full membership of the EU that is a way,1083.97,3.54,sbE-emYnHJk
460,of bringing people together and a,1086.37,2.939,sbE-emYnHJk
461,government that implements that decision,1087.51,3.629,sbE-emYnHJk
462,whatever it is very because you cannot,1089.309,2.731,sbE-emYnHJk
463,in the,1091.139,4.361,sbE-emYnHJk
464,you cannot end the uncertainty on brexit,1092.04,5.47,sbE-emYnHJk

467,you cannot negotiate a deal if you're,1100.75,4.05,sbE-emYnHJk
468,neutral on it it's absolutely an,1102.79,4.47,sbE-emYnHJk
469,inconceivable and I think it is a I'm,1104.8,4.02,sbE-emYnHJk
470,afraid to say a failure of leadership,1107.26,3.63,sbE-emYnHJk
471,not to have a position on the greatest,1108.82,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
472,issue facing this country at the moment,1110.89,3.27,sbE-emYnHJk
473,giver and cannot get a good deal for,1112.51,3.09,sbE-emYnHJk
474,this country if you don't believe it,1114.16,3.36,sbE-emYnHJk
475,like we want to understand how mr.,1115.6,4.65,sbE-emYnHJk
476,Corben proposes to negotiate when you,1117.52,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
477,put that to him and he's had the chance,1120.25,3.18,sbE-emYnHJk
478,to respond so let's move on to the,1121.63,3.15,sbE-emYnHJk
479,National Health Service another crucial,1123.43,3.45,sbE-emYnHJk
480,issue we've got a question from faith,1124.78,4.71,sbE-emYnHJk
481,Zaloom it's faiths illumise please thank,1126.88,4.8,sbE-emYnHJk
482,you I am returning to my nursing studies,1129.49,4.74,sbE-emYnHJk
483,next April it costs the lots to train as,1131.68,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
484,a nurse for the starting salaries are,1134.23,4.08,sbE-emYnHJk
485,low how would you deal with the shortage,1136,5.19,sbE-emYnHJk
486,of nurses and ensure the NHS can retain,1138.31,5.85,sbE-emYnHJk
487,them so faith who is a student nurse,1141.19,5.31,sbE-emYnHJk
488,says how would you deal with the,1144.16,4.95,sbE-emYnHJk
489,shortage of nurses and ensure that the,1146.5,5.43,sbE-emYnHJk
490,NHS can retain them Boris Johnson well,1149.11,4.47,sbE-emYnHJk
491,thank you very much for for what you're,1151.93,4.08,sbE-emYnHJk
492,doing and I believe passionately we need,1153.58,4.92,sbE-emYnHJk
493,to we need more nurses in the NHS I've,1156.01,5.22,sbE-emYnHJk
494,been in empowering office for about 130,1158.5,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
495,days and everything I've seen convincing,1161.23,3.48,sbE-emYnHJk
496,me this is now a time to invest,1162.91,3.66,sbE-emYnHJk
497,massively in our NHS so what we're doing,1164.71,5.73,sbE-emYnHJk
498,is putting in the biggest cash boost 34,1166.57,5.81,sbE-emYnHJk
499,billion pounds more 50 thousands more,1170.44,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
500,nurses and I should unpack that figure,1172.38,4.3,sbE-emYnHJk
501,people complain about it but it means,1174.73,4.79,sbE-emYnHJk
502,"retaining the 19,000 who might otherwise",1176.68,5.64,sbE-emYnHJk
503,drop out of the service and then,1179.52,5.23,sbE-emYnHJk
504,recruiting another 30 1000 new new,1182.32,4.92,sbE-emYnHJk
505,nurses plus we're bringing back the the,1184.75,3.68,sbE-emYnHJk
506,5000 pound,1187.24,3.78,sbE-emYnHJk
507,bursary one thing that we're doing that,1188.43,4.24,sbE-emYnHJk
508,I think is sensible that our Australian,1191.02,4.02,sbE-emYnHJk
509,star points based system allows us to do,1192.67,6.03,sbE-emYnHJk
510,is to encourage nurses from overseas to,1195.04,5.31,sbE-emYnHJk
511,come with a fill to fill some of the,1198.7,3.93,sbE-emYnHJk
512,gaps by shortening the time for their,1200.35,3.93,sbE-emYnHJk
513,their visa application now what I think,1202.63,5.28,sbE-emYnHJk
514,is totally incomprehensible is to have a,1204.28,5.52,sbE-emYnHJk
515,system where you try to get more nurses,1207.91,3.9,sbE-emYnHJk
516,and more staff into the NHS and,1209.8,3.66,sbE-emYnHJk
517,simultaneously ask the whole of the,1211.81,4.74,sbE-emYnHJk
518,public sector to work a four-day week,1213.46,6.06,sbE-emYnHJk
519,thank you very much patients are bad for,1216.55,4.47,sbE-emYnHJk
520,the energy Jeremy Corbyn thank you just,1219.52,2.67,sbE-emYnHJk
521,to remind you of the question,1221.02,3.45,sbE-emYnHJk
522,faith salut salut myth says how would,1222.19,3.51,sbE-emYnHJk
523,you deal with the shortage of,1224.47,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
524,and ensure the NHS can rotate well there,1225.7,5.31,sbE-emYnHJk
525,"are 43,000 nurse fakin C's at the",1228.34,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
526,present time it was a Conservative,1231.01,3.419,sbE-emYnHJk
527,government that cut the nurse bursary it,1232.63,3.45,sbE-emYnHJk
528,was a conservative and Liberal Democrat,1234.429,4.86,sbE-emYnHJk
529,coalition that increased student fees to,1236.08,6.51,sbE-emYnHJk
530,nine thousand pounds a year and that is,1239.289,5.281,sbE-emYnHJk
531,a major contributing factor to the,1242.59,4.14,sbE-emYnHJk
532,stress levels that exist within our NHS,1244.57,4.68,sbE-emYnHJk
533,it is a breaking point it is at crisis,1246.73,4.319,sbE-emYnHJk
534,point go to any any department and,1249.25,3.48,sbE-emYnHJk
535,you'll see that straight away so what we,1251.049,4.86,sbE-emYnHJk
536,do is end university fees which will,1252.73,5.34,sbE-emYnHJk
537,mean more people going to studying what,1255.909,4.171,sbE-emYnHJk
538,we will do is return the nurse bursaries,1258.07,3.569,sbE-emYnHJk
539,probably on a more generous scale than,1260.08,4.5,sbE-emYnHJk
540,it was in the past and we will recruit,1261.639,4.981,sbE-emYnHJk
541,as rapidly as we possibly can but,1264.58,4.53,sbE-emYnHJk
542,crucially will fund the NHS properly,1266.62,4.59,sbE-emYnHJk
543,forty billion pounds in total will go,1269.11,4.919,sbE-emYnHJk
544,into the NHS in order to fund it,1271.21,5.099,sbE-emYnHJk
545,properly and that has to be done the,1274.029,4.14,sbE-emYnHJk
546,Prime Minister the day after he was,1276.309,3.36,sbE-emYnHJk
547,appointed announced there was going to,1278.169,3.39,sbE-emYnHJk
548,be 40 new hospitals a week later that,1279.669,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
549,became 20 a bit later on it became six,1281.559,4.681,sbE-emYnHJk
550,new hospitals he seems to have a problem,1284.049,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
551,with the figures about hospital building,1286.24,10.439,sbE-emYnHJk
552,in Britain a new state mr corbyn who has,1288.279,9.451,sbE-emYnHJk
553,a problem we come up with these brexit,1296.679,7.321,sbE-emYnHJk
554,policy but the reality that we have a,1297.73,9,sbE-emYnHJk
555,very clear agenda which is to upgrade 20,1304,4.409,sbE-emYnHJk
556,hospitals to build 40 new ones it's,1306.73,3.75,sbE-emYnHJk
557,perfectly true that the cash allocation,1308.409,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
558,for the whole hospital build is for six,1310.48,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
559,initially but we're putting in the seed,1312.789,4.201,sbE-emYnHJk
560,funding now so they think do the,1314.59,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
561,architects drawings do the plans do all,1316.99,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
562,the business case so that in 10 years,1318.7,4.68,sbE-emYnHJk
563,time as a result of the decisions taken,1320.98,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
564,just in the last 130 days by this,1323.38,4.409,sbE-emYnHJk
565,government there will be 40 new what's,1325.36,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
566,wrong with that is to go in this country,1327.789,3.51,sbE-emYnHJk
567,well what's wrong with that is 12 hours,1329.23,4.53,sbE-emYnHJk
568,or 15 hours after being appointed Prime,1331.299,3.811,sbE-emYnHJk
569,Minister he came to Parliament and,1333.76,2.73,sbE-emYnHJk
570,grandly announced there was 40 new,1335.11,3.419,sbE-emYnHJk
571,hospitals it turned out the words that's,1336.49,3.179,sbE-emYnHJk
572,when he was asked where they were going,1338.529,3.181,sbE-emYnHJk
573,to be but that was then reduced to 20,1339.669,4.201,sbE-emYnHJk
574,and then it became seed funding for six,1341.71,5.37,sbE-emYnHJk
575,it's not credible to make those kind of,1343.87,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
576,statements and not be able to back it up,1347.08,3.719,sbE-emYnHJk
577,run with any serious plan he's,1348.85,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
578,incredible mr. Corbyn mr. Johnson asked,1350.799,3.48,sbE-emYnHJk
579,you a second ago is he credible to say,1352.72,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
580,you'll deal with nursing shortages while,1354.279,4.411,sbE-emYnHJk
581,agreeing to a four-day week which will,1356.71,2.97,sbE-emYnHJk
582,surely make the shortage,1358.69,3.36,sbE-emYnHJk
583,what we have said is that we want to see,1359.68,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
584,the working week come down at the,1362.05,3.21,sbE-emYnHJk
585,average working week across the country,1363.67,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
586,is it's the homemade hours and we,1365.26,4.53,sbE-emYnHJk
587,achieve bringing it down by improved,1367.54,4.08,sbE-emYnHJk
588,productivity industries and services,1369.79,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
589,there is no plan to bring in a four-day,1371.62,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
590,week in the NHS but there is a plan to,1373.75,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
591,properly invest in our NHS because I am,1376.03,4.529,sbE-emYnHJk
592,fed up with seeing people queuing and,1378.73,3.51,sbE-emYnHJk
593,waiting and being in desperate straits,1380.559,3.511,sbE-emYnHJk
594,trying to get an appointment to see a,1382.24,7.319,sbE-emYnHJk
595,job or to go into hospital MacDonald,1384.07,6.78,sbE-emYnHJk
596,said very clearly that there was a plan,1389.559,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
597,for a four-day working week and and and,1390.85,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
598,it's not clear why mr corbyn has,1393.429,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
599,resolved from that tonight but I what I,1395.11,3.9,sbE-emYnHJk
600,will say is that we will invest,1397.809,3.571,sbE-emYnHJk
601,massively in the NHS this is a new,1399.01,3.72,sbE-emYnHJk
602,government's very ambitious government I,1401.38,4.049,sbE-emYnHJk
603,want to see more funding going into our,1402.73,4.5,sbE-emYnHJk
604,public services we're leveling up,1405.429,3.541,sbE-emYnHJk
605,funding of education in schools around,1407.23,4.44,sbE-emYnHJk
606,"the country 20,000 more police but we",1408.97,4.35,sbE-emYnHJk
607,can only do that by having a strong,1411.67,3.27,sbE-emYnHJk
608,economy and the only way I mean you're,1413.32,2.67,sbE-emYnHJk
609,not going to like the snip the only way,1414.94,2.82,sbE-emYnHJk
610,we can have a strong economy is if we,1415.99,4.59,sbE-emYnHJk
611,move this country forward and get brexit,1417.76,5.46,sbE-emYnHJk
612,done and I just remind you one one three,1420.58,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
613,flavor one report that came out the,1423.22,3.54,sbE-emYnHJk
614,other day there is a hundred and fifty,1424.87,4.2,sbE-emYnHJk
615,billion pounds worth of investment,1426.76,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
616,waiting to come into this country if we,1429.07,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
617,can get my deal across the line thank,1431.14,5,sbE-emYnHJk
618,you this country thank you thank you,1433.39,5.28,sbE-emYnHJk

620,reference forgive me interrupting is,1438.67,3.78,sbE-emYnHJk
621,very close on the time and you've had,1440.2,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
622,rather odd just to make Corbin needs to,1442.45,3.479,sbE-emYnHJk
623,catch up that the conservatives and,1444.37,3.09,sbE-emYnHJk
624,liberals Democrats passed a Health and,1445.929,4.141,sbE-emYnHJk
625,Social Care Act after 2010 and that has,1447.46,5.82,sbE-emYnHJk
626,led to 10 billion pounds of private,1450.07,5.67,sbE-emYnHJk
627,sector involvement in the NHS with often,1453.28,4.14,sbE-emYnHJk
628,different wage structures and a,1455.74,4.46,sbE-emYnHJk
629,difficulty in management labour will end,1457.42,5.13,sbE-emYnHJk
630,privatization with the NHS and return it,1460.2,4.39,sbE-emYnHJk
631,to what it was always intended to be a,1462.55,4.379,sbE-emYnHJk
632,fully funded fully functioning Public,1464.59,4.53,sbE-emYnHJk
633,Health Service in this country you will,1466.929,4.921,sbE-emYnHJk
634,any privatization you say are you still,1469.12,4.86,sbE-emYnHJk
635,claiming that the NHS is up for sale,1471.85,4.02,sbE-emYnHJk
636,because your document doesn't seem to,1473.98,5.04,sbE-emYnHJk
637,show any such thing well read the,1475.87,5.939,sbE-emYnHJk
638,documents that were discussed in secret,1479.02,4.83,sbE-emYnHJk
639,and the government refused to release,1481.809,3.841,sbE-emYnHJk
640,them between themselves and the US,1483.85,5.1,sbE-emYnHJk
641,administration about access to public,1485.65,6.27,sbE-emYnHJk
642,services and the extension of the life,1488.95,4.47,sbE-emYnHJk
643,of patents,1491.92,3.93,sbE-emYnHJk
644,medicines which would increase medicine,1493.42,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
645,costs in this country President Trump,1495.85,3.78,sbE-emYnHJk
646,has said many times people pay too,1497.53,4.53,sbE-emYnHJk
647,little for us medicines around the world,1499.63,4.74,sbE-emYnHJk
648,that's the kind of agenda the Prime,1502.06,3.84,sbE-emYnHJk
649,Minister wants to get involved with,1504.37,3.6,sbE-emYnHJk
650,that's the kind of deal they're trying,1505.9,3.51,sbE-emYnHJk
651,to make with the US Horace Johnson he,1507.97,2.61,sbE-emYnHJk
652,says you want to sell the area you have,1509.41,3.66,sbE-emYnHJk
653,to say this is pure Bermuda Triangle,1510.58,3.81,sbE-emYnHJk
654,stuff we've heard it time and time again,1513.07,3.42,sbE-emYnHJk
655,from the Labour Party during this,1514.39,8.04,sbE-emYnHJk
656,election campaign men next I believe,1516.49,9.48,sbE-emYnHJk
657,very passionately in a I love it it's,1522.43,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
658,it's one of the most incredible things,1525.97,3.24,sbE-emYnHJk
659,about this country it is admired around,1527.41,3.6,sbE-emYnHJk
660,the world the central idea that if any,1529.21,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
661,of us gets sick all of us take care of,1531.01,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
662,them it's a fantastic thing now we,1533.08,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
663,believe in NHS free at the point of use,1535,4.83,sbE-emYnHJk
664,and no under no circumstances will we,1537.49,5.13,sbE-emYnHJk
665,sell it off to anybody in any kind of a,1539.83,5.93,sbE-emYnHJk
666,trader I would just remind I've just,1542.62,6,sbE-emYnHJk
667,refused what he's quoted which is that,1545.76,4.93,sbE-emYnHJk
668,American trade negotiators say they want,1548.62,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
669,more oxygen to the nhin I've made it,1550.69,5.28,sbE-emYnHJk

671,no circumstances will happen and with,1555.97,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
672,the biggest privatisation of the NHS of,1557.53,4.53,sbE-emYnHJk
673,course took place under the last Oh,1559.84,6.9,sbE-emYnHJk

729,record of raising the standards the,1696.01,6.12,sbE-emYnHJk
730,living standards of the poor socialism,1699.1,6.69,sbE-emYnHJk
731,or capitalism Jeremy Corbyn socialism,1702.13,6.48,sbE-emYnHJk
732,carried out in a democratic way in this,1705.79,5.58,sbE-emYnHJk
733,country in Scandinavia and other places,1708.61,5.19,sbE-emYnHJk
734,has raised the living standards of the,1711.37,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
735,very poorest and it was the post-war,1713.8,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
736,Labour government that did massively to,1715.78,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
737,improve the living standards of the,1717.97,3.24,sbE-emYnHJk
738,poorest working class communities in,1719.47,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
739,this country and our Labour government,1721.21,6.35,sbE-emYnHJk
740,will do the same again and I would say,1723.43,7.11,sbE-emYnHJk
741,it is one nation conservatism which,1727.56,4.81,sbE-emYnHJk
742,understands the vital importance of a,1730.54,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
743,dynamic market economy as the only way,1732.37,4.95,sbE-emYnHJk
744,in which you can pay for fantastic,1735.43,4.14,sbE-emYnHJk
745,public services and forgiving and for,1737.32,3.33,sbE-emYnHJk
746,looking after the poorest and neediest,1739.57,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
747,in our society that is the balance and,1740.65,4.65,sbE-emYnHJk
748,symmetry at the heart of what I'm trying,1743.26,4.35,sbE-emYnHJk
749,to achieve with this government and I,1745.3,4.95,sbE-emYnHJk
750,think that to attack capitalism as mr.,1747.61,5.91,sbE-emYnHJk
751,Corbyn and mr. McDonald do is absolutely,1750.25,4.77,sbE-emYnHJk
752,senseless and by the way could take,1753.52,4.08,sbE-emYnHJk
753,continue to attack all free trade is I,1755.02,3.82,sbE-emYnHJk
754,also think Oh,1757.6,4.72,sbE-emYnHJk
755,I think ignorant of the fat do you think,1758.84,5.07,sbE-emYnHJk
756,he wants to destroy capitalism Rio is,1762.32,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
757,that John McDonald who is the Shadow,1763.91,4.86,sbE-emYnHJk
758,Chancellor and some would say the the,1766.55,5.61,sbE-emYnHJk
759,intellectual driving force behind this,1768.77,6.99,sbE-emYnHJk
760,type of plyo socialism is committed he,1772.16,6.3,sbE-emYnHJk
761,says to fermenting the overthrow of,1775.76,5.28,sbE-emYnHJk
762,capitalism I think that is a is a,1778.46,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
763,mistake I don't think that's the right,1781.04,3.48,sbE-emYnHJk
764,way forward for our country I believe in,1782.69,3.33,sbE-emYnHJk
765,supporting businesses,1784.52,3.15,sbE-emYnHJk

770,million of our children living in,1792.8,1.74,sbE-emYnHJk
771,poverty,1794.06,2.01,sbE-emYnHJk

773,thousands of people sleeping on the,1796.07,3.09,sbE-emYnHJk
774,streets of this country the fifth,1797.57,3.27,sbE-emYnHJk
775,richest country in the world the,1799.16,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
776,inequality has got worse 150,1800.84,5.04,sbE-emYnHJk
777,billionaires in Britain more people poor,1803.45,3.12,sbE-emYnHJk
778,than ever,1805.88,2.73,sbE-emYnHJk
779,Jeremy thank you right we could him turn,1806.57,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
780,on to a broader question the moving on,1808.61,4.05,sbE-emYnHJk
781,so a broader question about the,1811.55,3,sbE-emYnHJk
782,economies are both of the leaders will,1812.66,3.24,sbE-emYnHJk
783,have the chance to talk at greater,1814.55,1.71,sbE-emYnHJk
784,length,1815.9,2.88,sbE-emYnHJk

788,government next week you will spend,1823.07,3.9,sbE-emYnHJk
789,spend spend making your plans your,1824.57,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
790,expenditure plans that is seem like a,1826.97,4.47,sbE-emYnHJk
791,fantasy how are you how are we really,1828.53,5.31,sbE-emYnHJk
792,going to pay for everything that you are,1831.44,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
793,promising Andrew Brooke thank you very,1833.84,2.64,sbE-emYnHJk
794,much indeed,1835.67,2.58,sbE-emYnHJk
795,spend spend spend he says you're both,1836.48,3.6,sbE-emYnHJk
796,going to do gentlemen he wants to know,1838.25,4.02,sbE-emYnHJk
797,how both of you are going to pay or,1840.08,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
798,rather how we're gonna pay for your,1842.27,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
799,plans boys John Andrew thank you very,1844.19,4.35,sbE-emYnHJk
800,much and we will certainly be making,1846.44,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
801,some big investments in as I say in the,1848.54,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
802,NHS in putting more police on the,1850.73,4.68,sbE-emYnHJk
803,streets in lifting up our education,1852.92,3.6,sbE-emYnHJk
804,funding for every school in the country,1855.41,2.94,sbE-emYnHJk
805,were to continue with that but what we,1856.52,4.77,sbE-emYnHJk
806,won't do is borrow hugely to fund,1858.35,6.21,sbE-emYnHJk
807,day-to-day investment and that is the,1861.29,5.37,sbE-emYnHJk
808,mistake that the Labour Party would make,1864.56,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
809,they would rack up our debts they would,1866.66,6.87,sbE-emYnHJk
810,put up spending to 1.2 trillion towards,1869.45,5.55,sbE-emYnHJk
811,your your question what that would mean,1873.53,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
812,"is a tax burden of 2,400 pounds a per",1875,5.7,sbE-emYnHJk
813,taxpayer and you know that you hear from,1878.51,4.56,sbE-emYnHJk
814,labour sometimes that the burden is I,1880.7,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
815,think mr. Corbyn said it just now the,1883.07,3.24,sbE-emYnHJk
816,burden is going to fall only on 150,1884.66,4.62,sbE-emYnHJk
817,billionaires or the top 5% actually,1886.31,5.04,sbE-emYnHJk
818,people on as little as twenty thousand,1889.28,2.67,sbE-emYnHJk
819,pounds,1891.35,3.48,sbE-emYnHJk
820,under their plans will be pay 1000,1891.95,5.099,sbE-emYnHJk
821,pounds a year more intact Jeremy Corbyn,1894.83,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
822,he says the people are not rich will pay,1897.049,3.391,sbE-emYnHJk
823,for your plans we're very clear about,1898.82,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
824,that and we are the only party that's,1900.44,5.01,sbE-emYnHJk
825,produced a fully costed manifesto with a,1902.99,4.649,sbE-emYnHJk
826,grade book that adds up to every piece,1905.45,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
827,of expenditure we want the problem with,1907.639,4.951,sbE-emYnHJk
828,this country is we've gone too far down,1909.83,5.099,sbE-emYnHJk
829,the road of free market economics we've,1912.59,5.459,sbE-emYnHJk
830,created too much inequality and if every,1914.929,5.161,sbE-emYnHJk
831,single bit of our manifesto was carried,1918.049,4.62,sbE-emYnHJk
832,out tomorrow we would just about reach,1920.09,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
833,the level of the public services of,1922.669,4.171,sbE-emYnHJk
834,France or Germany that is how far,1924.47,4.16,sbE-emYnHJk
835,backwards we've gone there has to be,1926.84,4.62,sbE-emYnHJk
836,investment in our schools why are so,1928.63,5.11,sbE-emYnHJk
837,many children in oversized classes why,1931.46,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
838,are so many children growing up in,1933.74,3.6,sbE-emYnHJk
839,insecure housing because there isn't the,1935.72,3.78,sbE-emYnHJk
840,sufficiency of council housing available,1937.34,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
841,why are there so many people waiting for,1939.5,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
842,Social Care why do so many people in,1941.33,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
843,middle-age have to go into debt to pay,1943.19,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
844,for their kids to go through university,1945.74,3.689,sbE-emYnHJk
845,and the social care that their older,1947.48,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
846,parents need it's simply time to invest,1949.429,6.771,sbE-emYnHJk
847,in our future Thank You Boris Johnson,1952.37,6.059,sbE-emYnHJk
848,and I agree but the difference between,1956.2,4.599,sbE-emYnHJk
849,mr. Corbyn and myself is that his plans,1958.429,4.081,sbE-emYnHJk
850,and we as I say we will be making,1960.799,3.211,sbE-emYnHJk
851,substantial investments within the,1962.51,3.36,sbE-emYnHJk
852,fiscal Headroom that we have but whilst,1964.01,4.529,sbE-emYnHJk
853,bearing down on our debt over the life,1965.87,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
854,of the Parliament but what we won't do,1968.539,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
855,is rack up such debts that the the,1970.25,5.61,sbE-emYnHJk
856,markets demand a higher interest rate,1973.429,5.88,sbE-emYnHJk
857,and you end up with huge tax burdens,1975.86,5.819,sbE-emYnHJk
858,falling on everybody else labour always,1979.309,4.681,sbE-emYnHJk
859,ends their time in office with an,1981.679,4.531,sbE-emYnHJk
860,economic crisis for billion more for me,1983.99,4.919,sbE-emYnHJk
861,Gordon and McDonald would start their,1986.21,4.679,sbE-emYnHJk
862,time in office with an economic crisis,1988.909,4.081,sbE-emYnHJk
863,mr. Goldman he says that all of us will,1990.889,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
864,pay more in our taxes not just the rich,1992.99,4.289,sbE-emYnHJk
865,and the independent think tanks like the,1995.269,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
866,Institute of Fiscal Studies agree that's,1997.279,3.63,sbE-emYnHJk
867,what they they don't agree with that,1999.139,3.63,sbE-emYnHJk
868,point actually what clearly not true,2000.909,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
869,they said of your claim that only the,2002.769,4.111,sbE-emYnHJk
870,top 5% of earners would pay more they,2004.779,4.711,sbE-emYnHJk
871,questioned some aspects of our program,2006.88,4.289,sbE-emYnHJk
872,and we're happy to discuss that with,2009.49,3.299,sbE-emYnHJk
873,them but we are the party that actually,2011.169,3.72,sbE-emYnHJk
874,produced the funding of it the,2012.789,4.35,sbE-emYnHJk
875,Conservative Party have produced nothing,2014.889,3.991,sbE-emYnHJk
876,in the way of how they're going to pay,2017.139,3.451,sbE-emYnHJk
877,for anything they suggest they're doing,2018.88,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
878,other than tax cuts it's very hard to,2020.59,4.199,sbE-emYnHJk
879,see how you can expand services if,2022.75,2.82,sbE-emYnHJk
880,you're cutting the,2024.789,2.521,sbE-emYnHJk
881,can base of government in the first,2025.57,3.75,sbE-emYnHJk
882,place a fair question is saying it there,2027.31,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
883,has to be investment to deal with the,2029.32,3.75,sbE-emYnHJk
884,inequalities within us how would you,2031.42,3.23,sbE-emYnHJk
885,pretend to cut taxes and pay for more,2033.07,4.68,sbE-emYnHJk
886,labor labor labor didn't produce the the,2034.65,5.02,sbE-emYnHJk
887,funding for anything I'm afraid it's the,2037.75,3.9,sbE-emYnHJk
888,hard work of the British people and it's,2039.67,3.51,sbE-emYnHJk
889,the heart it's it's British companies,2041.65,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
890,it's it's British businesses large and,2043.18,4.05,sbE-emYnHJk
891,small that produced the funding that,2045.61,4.35,sbE-emYnHJk
892,pays for our National Health Service and,2047.23,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
893,everything else and we're a government,2049.96,3.66,sbE-emYnHJk
894,that understands that if you're going to,2051.64,3.72,sbE-emYnHJk
895,have a dynamic market economy you cannot,2053.62,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
896,clobber them you can't clobber companies,2055.36,5.28,sbE-emYnHJk
897,with the highest taxes in in Europe,2057.49,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
898,which is what mr. Corbyn in the Labour,2060.64,3.36,sbE-emYnHJk
899,Party would do it would be entirely,2061.78,5.19,sbE-emYnHJk
900,wrong for this country to go down the,2064,4.53,sbE-emYnHJk
901,route that they're proposing I quoted,2066.97,4.02,sbE-emYnHJk
902,mr. Corbyn let me quote the McCue he,2068.53,4.44,sbE-emYnHJk
903,says your prospectus say the Institute,2070.99,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
904,of mystical studies top economic think,2072.97,4.59,sbE-emYnHJk
905,tank your prospect as they say is not,2075.16,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
906,credible well so you haven't said how,2077.56,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
907,you'll pay for Social km said how you'll,2079.45,3.63,sbE-emYnHJk
908,pay for future tax that's not credible,2081.25,4.56,sbE-emYnHJk
909,is it well I own the country our program,2083.08,4.59,sbE-emYnHJk
910,is fully costed is during the manifesto,2085.81,4.62,sbE-emYnHJk
911,and it's a great great program and the,2087.67,5.34,sbE-emYnHJk
912,one other advantage that we have apart,2090.43,4.47,sbE-emYnHJk
913,from not wrecking the economy and not,2093.01,4.56,sbE-emYnHJk
914,having a fiscal meltdown which is what,2094.9,5.61,sbE-emYnHJk
915,labour always do putting up taxes for,2097.57,5.97,sbE-emYnHJk
916,everybody we would get our country,2100.51,5.76,sbE-emYnHJk
917,moving forwards again by getting brexit,2103.54,5.07,sbE-emYnHJk
918,done and the economic drag anchor of,2106.27,5.07,sbE-emYnHJk
919,brexit on this country should not be,2108.61,5.07,sbE-emYnHJk
920,underestimated it is stopping investment,2111.34,4.13,sbE-emYnHJk
921,it means that people are uncertain about,2113.68,4.86,sbE-emYnHJk
922,making purchases about take your own the,2115.47,4.63,sbE-emYnHJk
923,good jobs what some certainly,2118.54,3.81,sbE-emYnHJk
924,government's always do is look after the,2120.1,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
925,very richest within our society they've,2122.35,4.02,sbE-emYnHJk
926,done very very well in the years of,2124.48,4.02,sbE-emYnHJk
927,austerity while it's communities all,2126.37,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
928,over the country they've paid for it,2128.5,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
929,with closed libraries closed swimming,2130.06,5.34,sbE-emYnHJk
930,pools out of reach pricing on sports,2132.19,5.76,sbE-emYnHJk
931,facilities lack of housing increased,2135.4,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
932,stress increased mental health stress we,2137.95,4.47,sbE-emYnHJk
933,have to redress the imbalances within,2140.29,6.59,sbE-emYnHJk
934,our society and King our tax proposals,2142.42,7.17,sbE-emYnHJk
935,for a corporation tax would be to raise,2146.88,4.24,sbE-emYnHJk
936,it to 26%,2149.59,4.14,sbE-emYnHJk
937,at the the end of the first period of,2151.12,3.84,sbE-emYnHJk
938,that labour government which will,2153.73,4.02,sbE-emYnHJk
939,actually be lower than it was in 2010,2154.96,4.56,sbE-emYnHJk
940,low than is in far,2157.75,4.08,sbE-emYnHJk
941,Lola is in the USA what we're proposing,2159.52,6.33,sbE-emYnHJk
942,is a serious set of plans in order to,2161.83,5.91,sbE-emYnHJk
943,stay addressing the imbalances within,2165.85,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
944,our society I think it's important to do,2167.74,2.4,sbE-emYnHJk
945,that,2169.81,2.76,sbE-emYnHJk
946,he's Clayton is basically it's a Prius,2170.14,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
947,into line with many countries around the,2172.57,3.48,sbE-emYnHJk
948,world in Western Europe I think it's,2174.55,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
949,quite incredible that mr. Corben should,2176.05,5.37,sbE-emYnHJk
950,"claim that people on 20,000 pounds a",2178.42,6.24,sbE-emYnHJk
951,year are amongst the richest in society,2181.42,5.22,sbE-emYnHJk
952,and therefore deserve to be clobbered by,2184.66,4.14,sbE-emYnHJk
953,his tax increases I think that is,2186.64,4.05,sbE-emYnHJk
954,totally wrong the burden of Taxation,2188.8,5.91,sbE-emYnHJk
955,always falls most heavily on those on,2190.69,5.58,sbE-emYnHJk
956,modest and low incomes that is what will,2194.71,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
957,happen if Labour are allowed to get in,2196.27,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
958,if we have a that's because you're,2198.58,3.75,sbE-emYnHJk
959,taking the burden of rituals in Sturgeon,2199.96,4.8,sbE-emYnHJk
960,coalition I'm afraid it will lead to an,2202.33,5.31,sbE-emYnHJk
961,economic disaster and worse still it,2204.76,5.52,sbE-emYnHJk
962,will lead to the political stalemate the,2207.64,4.62,sbE-emYnHJk
963,frustration for business that wants to,2210.28,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
964,get on and their uncertainty of not,2212.26,3.54,sbE-emYnHJk
965,knowing what the position on brexit is,2214.51,2.76,sbE-emYnHJk
966,and we still haven't heard from mr.,2215.8,3.36,sbE-emYnHJk
967,Corbyn and this debate has not been,2217.27,3.48,sbE-emYnHJk
968,running for 35 minutes whether he's in,2219.16,3.63,sbE-emYnHJk
969,favor of the deal that he is trying to,2220.75,5.28,sbE-emYnHJk
970,do and how he wouldn't go Sharia no you,2222.79,4.59,sbE-emYnHJk
971,know what the business organizations,2226.03,3.36,sbE-emYnHJk
972,tell me is they can't stand the,2227.38,3.57,sbE-emYnHJk
973,uncertainty of this government they,2229.39,3.9,sbE-emYnHJk
974,can't stand with the idea of a No Deal,2230.95,5.13,sbE-emYnHJk
975,exit they want to make sure they're able,2233.29,5.49,sbE-emYnHJk
976,to continue that trade and continue that,2236.08,4.92,sbE-emYnHJk
977,just-in-time delivery system that is so,2238.78,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
978,important in manufacturing industry and,2241,5.7,sbE-emYnHJk
979,they are constantly concerned at the,2243.1,5.7,sbE-emYnHJk
980,lack of understanding of how industry,2246.7,3.78,sbE-emYnHJk
981,works from a Conservative government,2248.8,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
982,that claims to be in support of those,2250.48,3.84,sbE-emYnHJk
983,industries what he said to use mr.,2252.79,2.79,sbE-emYnHJk
984,gorban I want to give you the chance to,2254.32,3.33,sbE-emYnHJk
985,answer it is that businesses even ones,2255.58,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
986,that were in favor of remain what,2257.65,3.36,sbE-emYnHJk
987,certainty they want clarity they want to,2259.27,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
988,get it done what's your answer to with,2261.01,5.58,sbE-emYnHJk
989,us you will get a deal which would be,2263.5,5.04,sbE-emYnHJk
990,leave but leave with the trade,2266.59,4.59,sbE-emYnHJk
991,arrangement or you get remain which will,2268.54,4.44,sbE-emYnHJk
992,obviously carry on the current situation,2271.18,4.05,sbE-emYnHJk
993,but they would have the certainty of,2272.98,4.65,sbE-emYnHJk
994,knowing what the trade relationship is,2275.23,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
995,where the investments going to come from,2277.63,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
996,and where the market is for the goods,2279.49,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
997,that are made in this country it's kind,2281.95,3.54,sbE-emYnHJk
998,of important to know those things thank,2283.72,3.36,sbE-emYnHJk
999,you very much gentlemen very briefly,2285.49,2.96,sbE-emYnHJk
1000,very briefly,2287.08,3.259,sbE-emYnHJk
1001,it is important to know those things but,2288.45,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
1002,he's absolutely unclear what that deal,2290.339,4.291,sbE-emYnHJk
1003,would be what mr. Coburn proposes to,2292.14,5.31,sbE-emYnHJk
1004,leave and who in his party proposes to,2294.63,4.649,sbE-emYnHJk
1005,campaign him the deal he's gained you've,2297.45,3.72,sbE-emYnHJk
1006,made that point very well early on let's,2299.279,3.211,sbE-emYnHJk
1007,turn to another question now a very,2301.17,3.48,sbE-emYnHJk
1008,important subject given the events of,2302.49,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
1009,recent days the issue of security and,2304.65,4.649,sbE-emYnHJk
1010,the question comes from Richard bow,2307.47,3.649,sbE-emYnHJk
1011,strode mr. bow straight please,2309.299,4.56,sbE-emYnHJk
1012,your most important responsibilities if,2311.119,3.91,sbE-emYnHJk
1013,you become Prime Minister in a week's,2313.859,3.24,sbE-emYnHJk
1014,time will be to keep us safe,2315.029,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
1015,given the terror attacks we've seen on,2317.099,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
1016,the streets of London are you prepared,2319.019,3.961,sbE-emYnHJk
1017,to put public safety ahead of human,2320.789,4.651,sbE-emYnHJk
1018,rights Jeremy Corbyn will you put public,2322.98,5.639,sbE-emYnHJk
1019,safety ahead of human rights mr.,2325.44,5.52,sbE-emYnHJk
1020,Badrinath it's not an either/or you,2328.619,3.811,sbE-emYnHJk
1021,obviously have to keep the public safe,2330.96,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
1022,you have to ensure that the police are,2332.43,5.55,sbE-emYnHJk
1023,there and properly funded you have to,2335.94,4.47,sbE-emYnHJk
1024,ensure the prison system works and is,2337.98,4.5,sbE-emYnHJk
1025,effective that the parole board works,2340.41,3.6,sbE-emYnHJk
1026,and is effective that the Probation,2342.48,3.569,sbE-emYnHJk
1027,Service works and is effective you have,2344.01,4.44,sbE-emYnHJk
1028,to give people that security you don't,2346.049,4.53,sbE-emYnHJk
1029,get security on the cheap you have to,2348.45,5.19,sbE-emYnHJk
1030,invest in it human rights are our,2350.579,5.821,sbE-emYnHJk
1031,defense against autocracy and our,2353.64,4.889,sbE-emYnHJk
1032,offense our defence against abuse of,2356.4,3.869,sbE-emYnHJk
1033,power there is no difference between,2358.529,3.691,sbE-emYnHJk
1034,wanting security and human rights the,2360.269,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
1035,two things that actually inextricably,2362.22,5.45,sbE-emYnHJk
1036,linked together Boris Johnson yes well,2364.259,6.711,sbE-emYnHJk
1037,absolutely no reason to compromise,2367.67,7.33,sbE-emYnHJk
1038,people's human rights such as the the,2370.97,7.059,sbE-emYnHJk
1039,perpetrator of the atrocious killings at,2375,5.7,sbE-emYnHJk
1040,London Bridge but I do think that it was,2378.029,4.711,sbE-emYnHJk
1041,extraordinary and wrong that he should,2380.7,6.3,sbE-emYnHJk
1042,be out on early release and automatic,2382.74,8.519,sbE-emYnHJk
1043,early release and I said long before I,2387,6.839,sbE-emYnHJk
1044,became Prime Minister that we needed a,2391.259,5.31,sbE-emYnHJk
1045,campaign against short sentences I said,2393.839,4.74,sbE-emYnHJk
1046,in August that we should get rid of,2396.569,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
1047,automatic early release and I've been,2398.579,5.43,sbE-emYnHJk
1048,very very sad to see this guy out on the,2400.859,5.7,sbE-emYnHJk
1049,streets able to do what he did and we,2404.009,5.731,sbE-emYnHJk
1050,have a bill waiting to go stuck because,2406.559,6.121,sbE-emYnHJk
1051,of the blockade in in Parliament if we,2409.74,4.799,sbE-emYnHJk
1052,can if we can get a working majority and,2412.68,3.629,sbE-emYnHJk
1053,we can get rid of automatic early,2414.539,4.8,sbE-emYnHJk
1054,release and make sure for serious sexual,2416.309,4.831,sbE-emYnHJk
1055,and violent offenders and make sure that,2419.339,2.401,sbE-emYnHJk
1056,tear,2421.14,2.729,sbE-emYnHJk
1057,people are convicted of terrorist,2421.74,5.52,sbE-emYnHJk
1058,offences serve their full sentence I,2423.869,5.611,sbE-emYnHJk
1059,think that is what this country would,2427.26,4.77,sbE-emYnHJk
1060,expect what is wrong mr. gorban with the,2429.48,4.139,sbE-emYnHJk
1061,idea just what that would geminal combat,2432.03,3.42,sbE-emYnHJk
1062,you what point what is wrong with the,2433.619,3.631,sbE-emYnHJk
1063,idea that Boris Johnson spells out there,2435.45,3.72,sbE-emYnHJk
1064,that terrorists particularly Jerry,2437.25,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
1065,should serve their full sentence you,2439.17,4.47,sbE-emYnHJk
1066,have to run a prison system and a,2441.48,4.74,sbE-emYnHJk
1067,judicial system in a proper way you have,2443.64,5.43,sbE-emYnHJk
1068,to have a prison system that works but,2446.22,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
1069,one day pretty well all prisoners are,2449.07,4.08,sbE-emYnHJk
1070,going to come out at some point but if,2451.2,3.98,sbE-emYnHJk
1071,you don't run a prison system that,2453.15,5.189,sbE-emYnHJk
1072,includes rehabilitation and you don't,2455.18,4.929,sbE-emYnHJk
1073,have a proper assessment of people,2458.339,3.841,sbE-emYnHJk
1074,before they're given any form of early,2460.109,3.721,sbE-emYnHJk
1075,release and a proper review of those,2462.18,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
1076,cases then there's obviously a danger to,2463.83,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
1077,all of us and so what happened on,2466.44,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
1078,streets of London was utterly appalling,2468.24,6.57,sbE-emYnHJk
1079,and I was very moved by what Jack,2470.43,6.96,sbE-emYnHJk
1080,Merritt's father said about what his son,2474.81,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
1081,was trying to do that he wanted a,2477.39,5.49,sbE-emYnHJk
1082,society where you did address the huge,2479.7,6.659,sbE-emYnHJk
1083,problems where somebody committed awful,2482.88,5.52,sbE-emYnHJk
1084,acts like that yes of course you must,2486.359,3.48,sbE-emYnHJk
1085,imprison them yes of course,2488.4,3.719,sbE-emYnHJk
1086,you must try and rehabilitate them if,2489.839,4.53,sbE-emYnHJk
1087,you can but there has to be a monitoring,2492.119,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
1088,process to achieve that we need the,2494.369,4.321,sbE-emYnHJk
1089,security on our streets security doesn't,2496.349,4.051,sbE-emYnHJk
1090,come on the cheap and if you cut the,2498.69,3.3,sbE-emYnHJk
1091,number of police officers cut the number,2500.4,3.949,sbE-emYnHJk
1092,of PCSOs privatize the Probation Service,2501.99,4.859,sbE-emYnHJk
1093,underfund all the other aspects of the,2504.349,4.811,sbE-emYnHJk
1094,criminal justice system then we all pay,2506.849,4.381,sbE-emYnHJk
1095,a price with our own security mr.,2509.16,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
1096,Johnson will you deal first of all,2511.23,4.95,sbE-emYnHJk
1097,please check Merritt's father did say,2513.03,6.24,sbE-emYnHJk
1098,that Jack lived and in the end died for,2516.18,5.52,sbE-emYnHJk
1099,a society in which quotes where we do,2519.27,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
1100,not lock up and throw away the key where,2521.7,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
1101,we focus on rehabilitation he said and,2524.16,5.82,sbE-emYnHJk
1102,not revenge of course and I have I have,2526.08,8.039,sbE-emYnHJk
1103,huge sympathy for mr. Merrit and the,2529.98,6.9,sbE-emYnHJk
1104,relatives families of both victims and,2534.119,5.011,sbE-emYnHJk
1105,it was an absolutely terrible thing but,2536.88,4.92,sbE-emYnHJk
1106,I still think it's wrong that something,2539.13,5.239,sbE-emYnHJk
1107,like was man Khan who was sentenced to,2541.8,6.569,sbE-emYnHJk
1108,21 years or 16 years plus 5 on own,2544.369,5.711,sbE-emYnHJk
1109,license should have been out,2548.369,4.591,sbE-emYnHJk
1110,automatically on eight years after eight,2550.08,5.46,sbE-emYnHJk
1111,years when the judge when he was first,2552.96,5.19,sbE-emYnHJk
1112,convicted made it clear that he was a,2555.54,5.7,sbE-emYnHJk
1113,very serious jihadi and a risk to public,2558.15,6.15,sbE-emYnHJk
1114,safety and under our government under my,2561.24,5.43,sbE-emYnHJk
1115,government of course we won't want to be,2564.3,5.04,sbE-emYnHJk
1116,compromising people's human rights it of,2566.67,5.34,sbE-emYnHJk
1117,course we won't but we must put public,2569.34,5.76,sbE-emYnHJk
1118,safety first quash that automatic,2572.01,5.37,sbE-emYnHJk
1119,automatic earlier release in such cases,2575.1,4.77,sbE-emYnHJk
1120,is I think completely unreasonable and,2577.38,3.75,sbE-emYnHJk
1121,we will get rid of could you address mr,2579.87,2.85,sbE-emYnHJk
1122,corbyn's point though that you have,2581.13,5.04,sbE-emYnHJk
1123,decimated the Probation Service the,2582.72,5.76,sbE-emYnHJk
1124,Prison Service as well many thousands,2586.17,4.77,sbE-emYnHJk
1125,fewer prison officers and the Probation,2588.48,3.81,sbE-emYnHJk
1126,Service as well as well as police,2590.94,3.63,sbE-emYnHJk
1127,officers during the era of austerity but,2592.29,5.1,sbE-emYnHJk
1128,Nick I mean it's just a small point of,2594.57,5.37,sbE-emYnHJk
1129,fact I mean there was no parole or,2597.39,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
1130,probation involved in this he was he was,2599.94,3.69,sbE-emYnHJk
1131,released automatically but your point,2601.68,5.19,sbE-emYnHJk
1132,and there was there was nothing that any,2603.63,4.83,sbE-emYnHJk
1133,parole board or probation officer could,2606.87,3.63,sbE-emYnHJk
1134,could do about that that was the nature,2608.46,5.34,sbE-emYnHJk
1135,of the sentence but there is a a valid,2610.5,6.06,sbE-emYnHJk
1136,question about how now we make sure that,2613.8,4.92,sbE-emYnHJk
1137,we have a criminal justice system that,2616.56,5.22,sbE-emYnHJk
1138,protects everybody and delivers justice,2618.72,4.5,sbE-emYnHJk
1139,and we are gonna get a relative,2621.78,2.79,sbE-emYnHJk
1140,agreement you may be a great we are,2623.22,4.05,sbE-emYnHJk
1141,putting a huge amount of cash into our,2624.57,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
1142,criminal justice system I do believe,2627.27,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
1143,that it should run smoothly and we're,2628.74,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
1144,putting another 2.5 billion into our,2631.44,3.66,sbE-emYnHJk
1145,into our prisons here we go you can only,2633.15,3.9,sbE-emYnHJk
1146,have if you have a strong economy thank,2635.1,3.93,sbE-emYnHJk
1147,you how seriously overcrowded prisons,2637.05,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
1148,we've lost a lot of prison officers and,2639.03,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
1149,when a prison is overcrowded as a,2641.16,3.72,sbE-emYnHJk
1150,shortage of officers the first thing,2643.2,3.36,sbE-emYnHJk
1151,that goes is education the next thing,2644.88,3.27,sbE-emYnHJk
1152,that goes is rehabilitation the next,2646.56,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
1153,thing that goes is medical support and,2648.15,4.5,sbE-emYnHJk
1154,so on so you end up with a breeding,2650.43,4.83,sbE-emYnHJk
1155,ground for all the horrors of the future,2652.65,5.67,sbE-emYnHJk
1156,if we go down that road we all pay a,2655.26,5.22,sbE-emYnHJk
1157,price so I'm simply saying this let's,2658.32,5.85,sbE-emYnHJk
1158,invest in our prison system invest in,2660.48,6.36,sbE-emYnHJk
1159,rehabilitation invest crucially in a,2664.17,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
1160,probation service that works,2666.84,3.78,sbE-emYnHJk
1161,it was privatized by this government ago,2668.49,3.27,sbE-emYnHJk
1162,we're saying it should have been,2670.62,2.79,sbE-emYnHJk
1163,completely in public owners just want to,2671.76,2.79,sbE-emYnHJk
1164,make sure you're answering a point he,2673.41,3.06,sbE-emYnHJk
1165,made mr. Johnson said to in this,2674.55,3.93,sbE-emYnHJk
1166,particular case it was not about,2676.47,3.51,sbE-emYnHJk
1167,resource it was not about the parole,2678.48,3.57,sbE-emYnHJk
1168,board of probation he says it was about,2679.98,4.83,sbE-emYnHJk
1169,sentences and you're opposed to the,2682.05,5.07,sbE-emYnHJk
1170,change he wants to make what I've said,2684.81,4.08,sbE-emYnHJk
1171,is there should be a review,2687.12,4.26,sbE-emYnHJk
1172,of the individual prisoner before,2688.89,5.16,sbE-emYnHJk
1173,release his countenance that I think is,2691.38,6.39,sbE-emYnHJk
1174,absolutely clear and that's why I asked,2694.05,6.27,sbE-emYnHJk
1175,for a role for both the parole board as,2697.77,4.77,sbE-emYnHJk
1176,well as the Probation Service in this,2700.32,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
1177,because listen what happened was,2702.54,5.7,sbE-emYnHJk
1178,unbelievably appalling and therefore we,2704.49,5.67,sbE-emYnHJk
1179,have to keep people safe and secure but,2708.24,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
1180,you don't do that by under investing in,2710.16,5.61,sbE-emYnHJk
1181,rehabilitation program well great,2712.41,5.64,sbE-emYnHJk
1182,inspector mr. Corben his Freddy's crew,2715.77,4.74,sbE-emYnHJk
1183,has consistently opposed longer,2718.05,5.88,sbE-emYnHJk
1184,sentences and when you look at mi5 the,2720.51,5.55,sbE-emYnHJk
1185,the body that keeps us safe particularly,2723.93,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
1186,from from terror attacks he's proposing,2726.06,4.77,sbE-emYnHJk
1187,to put in a Home Secretary in the form,2728.04,5.01,sbE-emYnHJk
1188,of Diane Albert who is called for mi5 to,2730.83,7.29,sbE-emYnHJk
1189,be disbanded mr. Corbin great respect to,2733.05,9,sbE-emYnHJk
1190,him I do not when you look at the huge,2738.12,6.51,sbE-emYnHJk
1191,issues of safety on the on public street,2742.05,2.97,sbE-emYnHJk
1192,sir,2744.63,2.76,sbE-emYnHJk
1193,knife crime you have a Labor Party that,2745.02,5.31,sbE-emYnHJk
1194,is adamantly sceptical opposed to stop,2747.39,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
1195,and search which I believe is an,2750.33,3.42,sbE-emYnHJk
1196,integral part of fighting crime on our,2751.38,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
1197,streets and we're not only going to put,2753.75,3.18,sbE-emYnHJk
1198,"20,000 more officers on the streets of",2755.34,3.24,sbE-emYnHJk

1200,this country gonna fight crime in the,2758.58,3.03,sbE-emYnHJk
1201,way that I think in in London we're,2760.02,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
1202,gonna back the police up let's get us in,2761.61,4.83,sbE-emYnHJk
1203,the government that cut the police force,2764.01,4.95,sbE-emYnHJk
1204,by such massive numbers privatized our,2766.44,5.01,sbE-emYnHJk
1205,probation service and got rid of all of,2768.96,5.01,sbE-emYnHJk

1207,forgive me miss already you've made the,2773.97,3.48,sbE-emYnHJk
1208,point about cuts he's going to you is,2775.59,3.81,sbE-emYnHJk
1209,that your Home Secretary died neighbor,2777.45,5.79,sbE-emYnHJk

1213,any other part of the security services,2790.62,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
1214,there are plans to invest properly in,2792.9,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
1215,our police and security services and,2795.51,4.59,sbE-emYnHJk
1216,when you live and represent an area like,2797.88,4.86,sbE-emYnHJk
1217,mine where somebody was murdered on the,2800.1,5.55,sbE-emYnHJk
1218,streets by a far-right terrorist attack,2802.74,5.49,sbE-emYnHJk
1219,on an individual you realize how,2805.65,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
1220,horrific that is for the community and,2808.23,4.29,sbE-emYnHJk
1221,how dangerous that is for all of us yes,2809.88,5.4,sbE-emYnHJk
1222,we do need to invest in all of our,2812.52,4.92,sbE-emYnHJk

1227,has a question for us Toby may you,2825.33,5.4,sbE-emYnHJk
1228,please from accusations of Islamophobia,2827.7,5.25,sbE-emYnHJk
1229,and anti-semitism in major parties to,2830.73,4.5,sbE-emYnHJk
1230,threats made against female MPs what,2832.95,3.81,sbE-emYnHJk

1234,Toby Mayhew hasn't he mentions,2840.84,5.04,sbE-emYnHJk
1235,Islamophobia anti-semitism and the,2843.21,6.3,sbE-emYnHJk
1236,threat against female MPs Boris Johnson,2845.88,4.95,sbE-emYnHJk
1237,I'm going to ask both you leaders to,2849.51,3.48,sbE-emYnHJk
1238,address problems in your own parties to,2850.83,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
1239,begin with of course you may make one to,2852.99,5.54,sbE-emYnHJk
1240,make points about other party said well,2855.24,5.79,sbE-emYnHJk
1241,I took I think you're making a very,2858.53,4.12,sbE-emYnHJk
1242,important point and everybody feels it,2861.03,3.66,sbE-emYnHJk
1243,at the moment this is a very rough time,2862.65,5.13,sbE-emYnHJk
1244,in in politics there's a lot of feeling,2864.69,6.29,sbE-emYnHJk
1245,at the moment and I think on prejudice,2867.78,5.94,sbE-emYnHJk
1246,Islamophobia anti-semitism what were,2870.98,4.03,sbE-emYnHJk
1247,doing in our party is having an,2873.72,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
1248,independent inquiry into into anybody,2875.01,5.1,sbE-emYnHJk
1249,who's guilty of any such offence and and,2877.83,4.59,sbE-emYnHJk
1250,there are at first bounce if they are if,2880.11,3.6,sbE-emYnHJk
1251,they're if they're if they're guilty I,2882.42,3.38,sbE-emYnHJk
1252,think when it comes to the protection,2883.71,5.67,sbE-emYnHJk
1253,particularly of a female MPs and women,2885.8,5.83,sbE-emYnHJk
1254,in politics it's vital that we give them,2889.38,5.01,sbE-emYnHJk
1255,the security that they they need them,2891.63,4.5,sbE-emYnHJk
1256,and we're doing a huge amount in the,2894.39,5.94,sbE-emYnHJk
1257,House of Commons to deliver that what we,2896.13,6.69,sbE-emYnHJk
1258,need to do is we need to come together,2900.33,4.56,sbE-emYnHJk
1259,as a country we've been going at this,2902.82,3.06,sbE-emYnHJk
1260,for too long,2904.89,2.58,sbE-emYnHJk
1261,and that one of the things and that this,2905.88,3,sbE-emYnHJk
1262,is I really am afraid this is my key,2907.47,3.45,sbE-emYnHJk
1263,point tonight the scratchiness of,2908.88,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
1264,politics the bitterness the acrimony is,2910.92,4.56,sbE-emYnHJk
1265,a function of our inability to get,2913.2,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
1266,brexit understood almost specific point,2915.48,5.7,sbE-emYnHJk
1267,that we are can do it and we will all,2918.09,6.15,sbE-emYnHJk
1268,can be out on January 31st and end what,2921.18,5.13,sbE-emYnHJk
1269,I think is misery for the come on the,2924.24,3.6,sbE-emYnHJk
1270,specific body about Islamophobia and,2926.31,2.73,sbE-emYnHJk
1271,then I'm going to turn to mr corbyn on,2927.84,4.14,sbE-emYnHJk
1272,anti-semitism you say people come out at,2929.04,5.1,sbE-emYnHJk
1273,first bounce but you have candidates,2931.98,5.43,sbE-emYnHJk
1274,have retweeted Tommy Robinson talking,2934.14,6,sbE-emYnHJk
1275,about quotes muslim paedophiles and a,2937.41,4.53,sbE-emYnHJk
1276,former chair of the Conservative Party,2940.14,4.5,sbE-emYnHJk
1277,says we have a serious and deep problem,2941.94,6.3,sbE-emYnHJk
1278,with Islamophobia yeah sorry very very,2944.64,5.84,sbE-emYnHJk
1279,quickly with all those all those,2948.24,4.44,sbE-emYnHJk
1280,candidates have either apologized are,2950.48,3.55,sbE-emYnHJk
1281,now subject to it,2952.68,4.65,sbE-emYnHJk
1282,investigation and you know I don't want,2954.03,5.85,sbE-emYnHJk
1283,to unnecessarily draw comparisons with,2957.33,4.56,sbE-emYnHJk
1284,the Labour Party but I do think it,2959.88,3.66,sbE-emYnHJk
1285,extraordinary that in this election,2961.89,3.6,sbE-emYnHJk
1286,we've heard for the first time in,2963.54,4.56,sbE-emYnHJk
1287,history the the chief rabbi say that he,2965.49,5.1,sbE-emYnHJk
1288,fears for his community in this country,2968.1,5.04,sbE-emYnHJk
1289,i were mr corbyn to be elected and i,2970.59,3.78,sbE-emYnHJk
1290,think it's a quite extraordinary state,2973.14,2.67,sbE-emYnHJk
1291,of affairs Jericho but it is,2974.37,2.94,sbE-emYnHJk
1292,extraordinary isn't it that the leader,2975.81,3.33,sbE-emYnHJk
1293,of a religious community has to warn,2977.31,3.78,sbE-emYnHJk
1294,people about you and your party,2979.14,4.53,sbE-emYnHJk
1295,anti-semitism is wrong and totally,2981.09,4.74,sbE-emYnHJk
1296,unacceptable in our society in our,2983.67,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
1297,parties in our political life and the,2985.83,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
1298,history of the awful trip to the Jewish,2987.99,4.14,sbE-emYnHJk
1299,people in the 19th century in Germany,2990.72,3.72,sbE-emYnHJk
1300,indicates exactly where that kind of,2992.13,4.08,sbE-emYnHJk
1301,language and that kind of racism leads,2994.44,3.42,sbE-emYnHJk
1302,us to there is no place for it,2996.21,3.9,sbE-emYnHJk
1303,whatsoever anywhere in our party or our,2997.86,4.65,sbE-emYnHJk
1304,society and there never will be as far,3000.11,6.39,sbE-emYnHJk
1305,as I'm concerned you see what Jewish,3002.51,6.45,sbE-emYnHJk
1306,matters of the Labor Party say is if,3006.5,4.5,sbE-emYnHJk
1307,this was black or Asian people who were,3008.96,4.62,sbE-emYnHJk
1308,victims of racism you would listen to,3011,6.06,sbE-emYnHJk
1309,them but when Jews say that your party,3013.58,5.73,sbE-emYnHJk
1310,under your leadership is infected with,3017.06,5.1,sbE-emYnHJk
1311,anti-jewish hatred you say no no I know,3019.31,3.45,sbE-emYnHJk
1312,better,3022.16,3.48,sbE-emYnHJk
1313,I don't know better than anybody I,3022.76,5.7,sbE-emYnHJk
1314,listen to people and amend if necessary,3025.64,5.22,sbE-emYnHJk
1315,the rules and processes I'm the leader,3028.46,4.71,sbE-emYnHJk
1316,that introduced an investigation process,3030.86,4.38,sbE-emYnHJk
1317,introduced a disciplinary process,3033.17,3.86,sbE-emYnHJk
1318,introduced a process of Education,3035.24,3.78,sbE-emYnHJk
1319,introduced a process for dealing with,3037.03,4.09,sbE-emYnHJk
1320,egregious cases and yes we have,3039.02,4.62,sbE-emYnHJk
1321,suspended or expelled members where we,3041.12,4.89,sbE-emYnHJk
1322,have found them guilty of anti-semitic,3043.64,4.83,sbE-emYnHJk
1323,behavior as indeed other parties have,3046.01,4.34,sbE-emYnHJk
1324,done the same but there are problems of,3048.47,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
1325,Islamophobia within our society also as,3050.35,4.51,sbE-emYnHJk
1326,you quite rightly draw attention to and,3052.79,4.23,sbE-emYnHJk
1327,there are problems of language that is,3054.86,5.01,sbE-emYnHJk
1328,used I do not ever use racist language,3057.02,5.82,sbE-emYnHJk
1329,in any form to describe anybody in this,3059.87,6.12,sbE-emYnHJk
1330,world or in our society as we say in the,3062.84,5.61,sbE-emYnHJk
1331,world we treat people with respect you,3065.99,3.66,sbE-emYnHJk

1337,that mr. Cogley I'm sure is very very,3079.43,3.81,sbE-emYnHJk
1338,well intentioned but I think that in,3081.59,3.15,sbE-emYnHJk
1339,these handling of this particular issue,3083.24,5.46,sbE-emYnHJk
1340,his unwillingness to take a stand to,3084.74,7.68,sbE-emYnHJk
1341,stand up for the Jewish people in the,3088.7,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
1342,labour party,3092.42,2.43,sbE-emYnHJk
1343,he's our willingness to protect them to,3093.02,3.78,sbE-emYnHJk
1344,put an armed run is it in my view a,3094.85,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
1345,failure of leadership you cannot be,3096.8,5.31,sbE-emYnHJk
1346,neutral on questions like this anymore,3099.26,5.1,sbE-emYnHJk
1347,in my view then you can try to lead this,3102.11,4.74,sbE-emYnHJk
1348,country and be neutral on the issue of,3104.36,5.52,sbE-emYnHJk
1349,brexit and it's and and it is it is a,3106.85,5.67,sbE-emYnHJk
1350,failure to take a stand and to have a,3109.88,4.95,sbE-emYnHJk
1351,point of view that in the end will cost,3112.52,5.91,sbE-emYnHJk
1352,this country gravely and deeply and I,3114.83,5.73,sbE-emYnHJk
1353,don't want to waste another year next,3118.43,6.05,sbE-emYnHJk
1354,year and more in in vacillation and,3120.56,6.57,sbE-emYnHJk
1355,confusion about what sort of position,3124.48,5.2,sbE-emYnHJk
1356,mr. Corbyn is willing to take what sort,3127.13,4.88,sbE-emYnHJk
1357,of leadership he's when you fail you,3129.68,4.65,sbE-emYnHJk
1358,leadership is when you use racist,3132.01,4.06,sbE-emYnHJk
1359,remarks to describe people in different,3134.33,3.96,sbE-emYnHJk
1360,countries or in our society I will never,3136.07,4.08,sbE-emYnHJk
1361,do that in my party will never do that,3138.29,5.4,sbE-emYnHJk
1362,and genitally makes the point that one,3140.15,5.58,sbE-emYnHJk
1363,way to take hate more generally out of,3143.69,4.8,sbE-emYnHJk
1364,politics he argues is to sort this,3145.73,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
1365,brexit Rao out because it's infecting,3148.49,4.44,sbE-emYnHJk

1372,is about the cohesion of our society,3168.74,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
1373,I hope the Prime Minister understands,3170.78,4.47,sbE-emYnHJk
1374,the hurt that people feel when they hear,3172.91,4.08,sbE-emYnHJk
1375,remarks and articles that he's written,3175.25,5.01,sbE-emYnHJk
1376,in the past I hope he will regret those,3176.99,5.28,sbE-emYnHJk

1399,claim to prove one thing and actually,3232.35,4.95,sbE-emYnHJk
1400,prove something quite different Jeremy,3234.99,5.04,sbE-emYnHJk
1401,Corbyn I think it's important when,3237.3,4.59,sbE-emYnHJk
1402,people go into an election campaign they,3240.03,3.36,sbE-emYnHJk
1403,put forward a policy of what they're,3241.89,3.12,sbE-emYnHJk

1407,democratic process to deal with that in,3249.6,4.11,sbE-emYnHJk
1408,the future that is what democracy is,3251.88,4.17,sbE-emYnHJk
1409,about it's about holding people to,3253.71,4.92,sbE-emYnHJk
1410,account and holding government to,3256.05,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
1411,account in Parliament and I want to see,3258.63,3.93,sbE-emYnHJk
1412,not a weaker but a stronger House of,3260.37,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
1413,Commons in the future that holds our,3262.56,3.84,sbE-emYnHJk
1414,government to account to make sure we,3264.24,4.2,sbE-emYnHJk

1423,shows to me is that we need to move on,3284.25,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
1424,as a country because there are plenty of,3287.85,5,sbE-emYnHJk
1425,people who are irreconcilably opposed to,3289.23,5.85,sbE-emYnHJk
1426,brexit and I think that actually what we,3292.85,4.18,sbE-emYnHJk
1427,should do is respect the will of the,3295.08,4.32,sbE-emYnHJk
1428,people that people talk about trust in,3297.03,5.19,sbE-emYnHJk

1624,neoliberal sometimes don't he he came,3838.13,4.5,sbE-emYnHJk
1625,around suggest his way of thinking a,3840.92,5.76,sbE-emYnHJk
1626,little bit but then again I prefer,3842.63,8.49,sbE-emYnHJk
1627,someone who's to the left that's the,3846.68,6.75,sbE-emYnHJk
1628,problem with today's politics like you,3851.12,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
1629,said the word neoliberal people look at,3853.43,2.55,sbE-emYnHJk
1630,your funny like they don't know what the,3854.99,3.87,sbE-emYnHJk
1631, it actually is which is a bit weird,3855.98,4.56,sbE-emYnHJk
1632,considering we've had that since like,3858.86,2.34,sbE-emYnHJk
1633,Sasha,3860.54,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
1634,I thought it was a neoliberal she wasn't,3861.2,4.98,sbE-emYnHJk
1635,to the right people think that was the,3864.53,4.65,sbE-emYnHJk
1636,right and it wasn't you know liberals,3866.18,6.84,sbE-emYnHJk
1637,been here since after the war wages have,3869.18,5.46,sbE-emYnHJk

1641,thing called globalization remember that,3879.5,4.41,sbE-emYnHJk
1642,word globalization,3881.57,3.719,sbE-emYnHJk
1643,yeah that's called neoliberalism,3883.91,3.869,sbE-emYnHJk
1644,basically where the free markets,3885.289,4.951,sbE-emYnHJk
1645,run the planet and everybody else gets,3887.779,6.171,sbE-emYnHJk
1646,basically I said called,3890.24,10.71,sbE-emYnHJk
1647, zero hour contracts I mean your,3893.95,8.5,sbE-emYnHJk
1648,wages should be at least fifteen pound,3900.95,3.059,sbE-emYnHJk
1649,an hour at least that should be the,3902.45,4.94,sbE-emYnHJk
1650,minimum wage but apparently you know,3904.009,5.61,sbE-emYnHJk
1651,that Gordon Brown didn't help when he,3907.39,4.149,sbE-emYnHJk
1652,was in charge he gave her by tax credits,3909.619,3.99,sbE-emYnHJk
