124,Good Friday Agreement with Europe all,357.669,3.481,9kEB5pqWpJw
125,remaining as full members of the,359.2,4.08,9kEB5pqWpJw
126,European Union that will be the choice,361.15,4.08,9kEB5pqWpJw
127,put before the British people the idea,363.28,4.35,9kEB5pqWpJw
128,that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson's,365.23,5.4,9kEB5pqWpJw
129,deal can be dealt with and finished by,367.63,3.99,9kEB5pqWpJw
130,the end of January,370.63,3.66,9kEB5pqWpJw
131,is such nonsense what he's proposing is,371.62,4.38,9kEB5pqWpJw
132,a trade deal with the United States that,374.29,3.33,9kEB5pqWpJw
133,would take at least seven years to,376,3.72,9kEB5pqWpJw
134,negotiate whilst at the same time saying,377.62,4.2,9kEB5pqWpJw
135,he would negotiate a special trade deal,379.72,4.38,9kEB5pqWpJw
136,with the European Union the two things,381.82,4.77,9kEB5pqWpJw
137,are actually incompatible Thank You mr.,384.1,12.15,9kEB5pqWpJw
138,Corbyn sillas so to open the debate mr.,386.59,12.21,9kEB5pqWpJw
139,Johnson said that he claims he has a,396.25,4.889,9kEB5pqWpJw
140,deal that is ready to go that you would,398.8,5.67,9kEB5pqWpJw
141,have to negotiate a new deal after three,401.139,5.4,9kEB5pqWpJw
142,years since we voted to lead the,404.47,4.41,9kEB5pqWpJw
143,European Union on that point how would,406.539,3.721,9kEB5pqWpJw
144,you respond well the Prime Minister,408.88,4.289,9kEB5pqWpJw
145,Boris Johnson voted twice against,410.26,5.34,9kEB5pqWpJw
146,Theresa May Mays deal one time for it,413.169,4.141,9kEB5pqWpJw
147,then proposed his own deal which,415.6,3.569,9kEB5pqWpJw
148,narrowly got through the House of,417.31,3.9,9kEB5pqWpJw
149,Commons with the support of the DUP,419.169,4.171,9kEB5pqWpJw
150,which is actually even worse than,421.21,4.95,9kEB5pqWpJw
151,Theresa Mays deal he cannot protect jobs,423.34,3.75,9kEB5pqWpJw
152,in this country,426.16,3.93,9kEB5pqWpJw
153,on that basis and I think it is time,427.09,5.52,9kEB5pqWpJw
154,that we actually recognize we have to,430.09,4.889,9kEB5pqWpJw
155,maintain a firm and good trading,432.61,4.559,9kEB5pqWpJw
156,relationship with Europe otherwise more,434.979,3.931,9kEB5pqWpJw
157,jobs will be lost all over the country,437.169,3.661,9kEB5pqWpJw
158,as they already been lost because of the,438.91,4.47,9kEB5pqWpJw
159,uncertainty well we have a great deal,440.83,6.269,9kEB5pqWpJw
160,that is supported as mr. Corbyn says not,443.38,6.45,9kEB5pqWpJw
161,just by many members of his own party,447.099,5.851,9kEB5pqWpJw
162,but by the entire conservative party now,449.83,6.209,9kEB5pqWpJw
163,and 635 conservative candidates have,452.95,6.39,9kEB5pqWpJw
164,backed it and what is the alternative,456.039,5.88,9kEB5pqWpJw
165,it's it's under Jeremy Corbyn the Labour,459.34,6.359,9kEB5pqWpJw
166,Party to consecrate next year to a,461.919,5.551,9kEB5pqWpJw
167,three-month extension in which he would,465.699,4.111,9kEB5pqWpJw
168,and mr. Coburn proposes to negotiate a,467.47,6.06,9kEB5pqWpJw
169,new treaty and then to put that to the,469.81,6.03,9kEB5pqWpJw
170,people in a referendum but we don't know,473.53,4.29,9kEB5pqWpJw
171,and I've asked this before we don't know,475.84,4.77,9kEB5pqWpJw
172,on which side mr. Corbyn would campaign,477.82,5.159,9kEB5pqWpJw
173,is he going to campaign for leave can,480.61,4.739,9kEB5pqWpJw
174,remote can we ask mr. Corbyn to respond,482.979,6.94,9kEB5pqWpJw
175,very clearly we will we will negotiate,485.349,8.451,9kEB5pqWpJw
176,we will negotiate an agreement and we'll,489.919,6.76,9kEB5pqWpJw
177,put that alongside remain in a,493.8,5.31,9kEB5pqWpJw
178,referendum and our government will abide,496.679,4.47,9kEB5pqWpJw
179,by that result I will carry out the,499.11,3.63,9kEB5pqWpJw
180,result of that referendum there will be,501.149,4.591,9kEB5pqWpJw
181,a genuine choice put before the people,502.74,4.979,9kEB5pqWpJw
182,of Britain to make their decision and we,505.74,9.709,9kEB5pqWpJw
183,will carry it out at this election what,507.719,11.49,9kEB5pqWpJw
184,we're asking is for a mandate to govern,515.449,5.89,9kEB5pqWpJw
185,and mr. Corbin is asking the people for,519.209,3.89,9kEB5pqWpJw
186,a mandate to conduct a new negotiation,521.339,3.631,9kEB5pqWpJw
187,next year when we don't need one because,523.099,3.821,9kEB5pqWpJw
188,we've already got a deal I think what,524.97,4.38,9kEB5pqWpJw
189,people need to understand is whether he,526.92,4.89,9kEB5pqWpJw
190,believes in the deal that he is,529.35,5.549,9kEB5pqWpJw
191,proposing to do does he actually want to,531.81,5.639,9kEB5pqWpJw
192,do this deal because if he doesn't,534.899,5.461,9kEB5pqWpJw
193,believe in it or if absurdly he was then,537.449,4.471,9kEB5pqWpJw
194,going to campaign against it in the,540.36,3.36,9kEB5pqWpJw
195,forthcoming but I'd like to run a,541.92,4.25,9kEB5pqWpJw
196,question directly to mr. Gore which is,543.72,4.679,9kEB5pqWpJw
197,offering him at the question and I,546.17,4.12,9kEB5pqWpJw
198,wonder where the mr. Colby could now,548.399,4.05,9kEB5pqWpJw
199,tell us are you going to campaign for,550.29,3.84,9kEB5pqWpJw
200,leave or remain I want to bring people,552.449,3.931,9kEB5pqWpJw
201,together therefore there will be a,554.13,4.62,9kEB5pqWpJw
202,referendum in which that decision will,556.38,4.29,9kEB5pqWpJw
203,be made by the British people and our,558.75,3.569,9kEB5pqWpJw
204,government will abide by that decision,560.67,4.979,9kEB5pqWpJw
205,when you say you'll get it done really,562.319,5.311,9kEB5pqWpJw
206,mr. Johnson you are going to embark on,565.649,4.62,9kEB5pqWpJw
207,probably seven years of negotiations,567.63,4.68,9kEB5pqWpJw
208,with the United States on a trade deal,570.269,5.67,9kEB5pqWpJw
209,you've already indicated that you will,572.31,5.37,9kEB5pqWpJw
210,allow our national health service to be,575.939,3.75,9kEB5pqWpJw
211,put at risk by a trade deal with the,577.68,4.23,9kEB5pqWpJw
212,United States you've already indicated,579.689,4.561,9kEB5pqWpJw
213,that you would do a Canada style,581.91,3.81,9kEB5pqWpJw
214,agreement which took at least seven,584.25,3.66,9kEB5pqWpJw
215,years to negotiate so you're not going,585.72,3.75,9kEB5pqWpJw
216,to get it done in a few months and you,587.91,4.46,9kEB5pqWpJw
217,know that perfectly well,589.47,2.9,9kEB5pqWpJw
218,I'm noting I'm noting here of course,595.339,4.8,9kEB5pqWpJw
219,that we haven't heard whether you would,597.959,4.831,9kEB5pqWpJw
220,campaign for a main or it's leaving that,600.139,4.271,9kEB5pqWpJw
221,situation but it is important that we,602.79,3.33,9kEB5pqWpJw
222,put the point that you have just made,604.41,3.359,9kEB5pqWpJw
223,directly to mr. Johnson about this,606.12,3.389,9kEB5pqWpJw
224,timetable let's have a look at the,607.769,4.081,9kEB5pqWpJw
225,timetable you reckon you can get your,609.509,4.62,9kEB5pqWpJw
226,divorce deal done and a trade deal done,611.85,5.82,9kEB5pqWpJw
227,by December 2020 do you stick on a,614.129,6.39,9kEB5pqWpJw

798,of services across the NHS and I think,2391.72,4.889,9kEB5pqWpJw

830,debt from people trying to look after,2480.91,4.56,9kEB5pqWpJw
831,children look after older people I think,2482.86,5.67,9kEB5pqWpJw
832,the first thing has to be an increase in,2485.47,5.4,9kEB5pqWpJw
833,wages by having a ten-pound on our,2488.53,5.1,9kEB5pqWpJw

846,electoral period I I would just point,2519.13,5.97,9kEB5pqWpJw
847,out that I have shelved a plan to cut,2521.53,7.26,9kEB5pqWpJw
848,corporation tax saving it's already the,2525.1,5.64,9kEB5pqWpJw

852,gives us the ability to put another six,2535.09,5.22,9kEB5pqWpJw
853,billion pounds into the NHS and other,2536.98,5.49,9kEB5pqWpJw
854,priorities and we will do that we can do,2540.31,3.9,9kEB5pqWpJw
855,that because we have a strong economy,2542.47,3.78,9kEB5pqWpJw
856,and what worries me about this country,2544.21,3.51,9kEB5pqWpJw
857,at the moment is that we are going to,2546.25,3.45,9kEB5pqWpJw
858,continue with this pointless paralysis,2547.72,3.87,9kEB5pqWpJw
859,I'm have notion know I know the,2549.7,4.11,9kEB5pqWpJw

883,destroy the basis of wealth creation in,2614.75,3.78,9kEB5pqWpJw
884,this country I have to say I think that,2616.64,9.84,9kEB5pqWpJw
885,would be disaster for this corporation,2618.53,11.19,9kEB5pqWpJw
886,tax to around the levels it was in 2010,2626.48,5.129,9kEB5pqWpJw

1244,underdog emerged as the underdog - I,3580.02,6.66,9kEB5pqWpJw
1245,think he's emerged as a man of integrity,3583.38,5.91,9kEB5pqWpJw

1250,most important election in a generation,3595.41,4.709,9kEB5pqWpJw
1251,and I think Boris Johnson came across as,3597.57,6.12,9kEB5pqWpJw
1252,a deeply dishonest man Jeremy Corbyn did,3600.119,5.431,9kEB5pqWpJw
1253,struggle to land his point quite a few,3603.69,3.06,9kEB5pqWpJw

1260,boys Johnson we just put a bluster,3618.06,3.24,9kEB5pqWpJw
1261,everything he tried to extort cloak and,3619.71,3.99,9kEB5pqWpJw
1262,umbrella in like a fake brexit debate,3621.3,4.95,9kEB5pqWpJw
1263,it's just pure fake news Boris Johnson,3623.7,4.74,9kEB5pqWpJw
1264,talked about the NHS with compassion he,3626.25,4.23,9kEB5pqWpJw
1265,talks about nurses or doctors he talked,3628.44,3.75,9kEB5pqWpJw
1266,about schools he talked about all the,3630.48,3.27,9kEB5pqWpJw
1267,policies there's going to make the,3632.19,3.81,9kEB5pqWpJw
1268,difference in real people's lives Boris,3633.75,3.93,9kEB5pqWpJw
1269,Johnson isn't even in touch with his own,3636,2.91,9kEB5pqWpJw
1270,feelings let alone the rest of the,3637.68,3.81,9kEB5pqWpJw
1271,country is actually absolutely not and,3638.91,4.38,9kEB5pqWpJw
1272,quite frankly what we saw this evening,3641.49,3.72,9kEB5pqWpJw
1273,there's only one prime minister in the,3643.29,3.66,9kEB5pqWpJw
1274,room and on the stage tonight and that,3645.21,4.2,9kEB5pqWpJw
1275,was Boris Johnson he was unequivocal,3646.95,4.2,9kEB5pqWpJw
1276,very clear that the Conservative Party,3649.41,4.38,9kEB5pqWpJw
1277,under his leadership is the only party,3651.15,4.62,9kEB5pqWpJw
1278,that will lead a government that will,3653.79,3.81,9kEB5pqWpJw
1279,get brexit done and that's what the,3655.77,8.31,9kEB5pqWpJw
1280,British public let me finish and with,3657.6,8.85,9kEB5pqWpJw
1281,that once we get brexit done and this is,3664.08,4.26,9kEB5pqWpJw
1282,the key thing and to be fair Jeremy,3666.45,3.659,9kEB5pqWpJw
1283,Corbyn could not even answer what he was,3668.34,3.54,9kEB5pqWpJw
1284,going to do on brexit he refused nine,3670.109,4.171,9kEB5pqWpJw
1285,times and when we speak about trust in,3671.88,4.229,9kEB5pqWpJw
1286,politics and the breakdown in politics,3674.28,3.45,9kEB5pqWpJw
1287,and the gridlock we've seen in,3676.109,3.781,9kEB5pqWpJw
1288,Westminster the fact that Jeremy Corbyn,3677.73,5.639,9kEB5pqWpJw
1289,can't even out because that's exactly,3679.89,5.67,9kEB5pqWpJw
1290,what he wanted that was exactly the line,3683.369,4.081,9kEB5pqWpJw
1291,that they prepared that's exactly the,3685.56,3.33,9kEB5pqWpJw
1292,line that wanted to say but let me,3687.45,3.15,9kEB5pqWpJw
1293,answer it for you pretty the thing is,3688.89,4.38,9kEB5pqWpJw
1294,this jeremy corbyn as Prime Minister is,3690.6,5.1,9kEB5pqWpJw
1295,not for him to deliver what he wants is,3693.27,4.05,9kEB5pqWpJw
1296,for him to deliver what the country,3695.7,3.18,9kEB5pqWpJw
1297,wants and that's the different between,3697.32,4.53,9kEB5pqWpJw
1298,Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn Jeremy,3698.88,4.56,9kEB5pqWpJw
1299,Corbyn will deliver what the country,3701.85,7.98,9kEB5pqWpJw
1300,when the brexit deal in Parliament let's,3703.44,8.82,9kEB5pqWpJw
1301,tell the country the truth I'm so,3709.83,5.19,9kEB5pqWpJw
1302,irritated by that man I cannot tell you,3712.26,4.2,9kEB5pqWpJw
1303,well and actually the audience seemed,3715.02,3.089,9kEB5pqWpJw
1304,fairly irritated at times superteam said,3716.46,3.72,9kEB5pqWpJw
1305,I mean the audience laughed down Boris,3718.109,3.721,9kEB5pqWpJw
1306,Johnson when he was asked about trust,3720.18,4.58,9kEB5pqWpJw
1307,and whether tell in a note,3721.83,4.88,9kEB5pqWpJw
1308,the audience is so laughed at mr corbyn,3724.76,4.44,9kEB5pqWpJw
1309,on his brexit policy as well it was,3726.71,5.04,9kEB5pqWpJw
1310,absolutely clear and abundant there is,3729.2,5.01,9kEB5pqWpJw
1311,no clear policy on brexit and I have to,3731.75,4.44,9kEB5pqWpJw
1312,say dawn but British public voted in,3734.21,3.84,9kEB5pqWpJw
1313,2016 it was called the EU referendum,3736.19,4.26,9kEB5pqWpJw
1314,they voted to leave and actually what,3738.05,4.47,9kEB5pqWpJw
1315,kind of democracy do we live in if the,3740.45,3.99,9kEB5pqWpJw
1316,labour party effectively proposing for,3742.52,3.45,9kEB5pqWpJw
1317,next year that would have two,3744.44,30.63,9kEB5pqWpJw
1318,referendums because we wants to do that,3745.97,31.02,9kEB5pqWpJw
1319,we are the only party that is saying to,3775.07,3.78,9kEB5pqWpJw

1324,actually oddly some kind of consider,3808.28,4.2,9kEB5pqWpJw
1325,tree moments in this debate - most,3810.11,3.93,9kEB5pqWpJw
1326,notably a moment when the two leaders,3812.48,4.02,9kEB5pqWpJw
1327,shook hands when Julie Etchingham was,3814.04,3.69,9kEB5pqWpJw
1328,asking them whether they could shake,3816.5,3.84,9kEB5pqWpJw
1329,hands and promise not to allow this kind,3817.73,6.3,9kEB5pqWpJw
1330,of festering anger in politics to grow,3820.34,6.03,9kEB5pqWpJw
1331,and to become any worse and there was an,3824.03,3.69,9kEB5pqWpJw
1332,interesting moment when they were asked,3826.37,2.82,9kEB5pqWpJw
1333,I think we've got a clip of it here,3827.72,3.99,9kEB5pqWpJw
1334,actually whether they would give each,3829.19,4.26,9kEB5pqWpJw
1335,other a Christmas present and what they,3831.71,2.94,9kEB5pqWpJw

1386,main thing that came out of it for us,3965.609,3.871,9kEB5pqWpJw
1387,the Brixton party was the Prime,3967.2,4.8,9kEB5pqWpJw

1428,another barrier yeah I think that's,4045.84,2.55,9kEB5pqWpJw

1430,Tories will be speaking to spinners from,4048.39,2.37,9kEB5pqWpJw

1440,audience like that,4064.77,3.33,9kEB5pqWpJw
1441,whooping clapping yeah almost booing,4065.49,4.2,9kEB5pqWpJw
1442,people's reactions I think it's a sign,4068.1,3.6,9kEB5pqWpJw
1443,of the times that politics is so divided,4069.69,4.08,9kEB5pqWpJw
1444,in people and that gloss of politicians,4071.7,3.75,9kEB5pqWpJw
1445,has kind of gone he will feel like and,4073.77,2.76,9kEB5pqWpJw
1446,shout with them boo at them clapper,4075.45,3.45,9kEB5pqWpJw

1452,around this way maybe if we go well this,4087.27,3.87,9kEB5pqWpJw
1453,is gonna be a dead end this way that's a,4089.34,2.37,9kEB5pqWpJw
1454,bad idea,4091.14,3.01,9kEB5pqWpJw
1455,Robert,4091.71,4.369,9kEB5pqWpJw
1456,we're going to the same place as you,4094.15,8.589,9kEB5pqWpJw

1458,chasing you down the live spot come over,4102.739,4.92,9kEB5pqWpJw
1459,to this camera here let's have one final,4105.739,3.661,9kEB5pqWpJw
1460,chat with you Robert that's no idea of,4107.659,3.27,9kEB5pqWpJw
1461,course have you come here just so we can,4109.4,4.859,9kEB5pqWpJw
1462,get my shot you okay do you think not to,4110.929,5.04,9kEB5pqWpJw
1463,be changed anything in this lecture of,4114.259,2.07,9kEB5pqWpJw
1464,it,4115.969,4.46,9kEB5pqWpJw
1465,probably not I thought both leaders,4116.329,7.62,9kEB5pqWpJw
1466,performed as well as their teams could,4120.429,6.52,9kEB5pqWpJw
1467,have hoped there were no significant,4123.949,8.16,9kEB5pqWpJw
1468,flux sure you can say him to all our I,4126.949,10.261,9kEB5pqWpJw
1469,guess or talking about guess the voice,4132.109,7.771,9kEB5pqWpJw
1470,Johnson was at time but not us but not,4137.21,4.529,9kEB5pqWpJw
1471,honestly consistent in the bags,4139.88,10.79,9kEB5pqWpJw
1472,you know he's get done he used not seem,4141.739,10.86,9kEB5pqWpJw
1473,particularly relevant to the brexit,4150.67,4.629,9kEB5pqWpJw
1474,question use every possible question to,4152.599,5.16,9kEB5pqWpJw
1475,get back to the fact that he claims that,4155.299,4.71,9kEB5pqWpJw
1476,he has a simple deal that we get through,4157.759,4.141,9kEB5pqWpJw
1477,Parliament I was slightly surprised for,4160.009,3.27,9kEB5pqWpJw
1478,example though that during become we,4161.9,2.669,9kEB5pqWpJw
1479,didn't challenge him about how he's,4163.279,2.67,9kEB5pqWpJw
1480,gonna get his trade deal but done by the,4164.569,4.351,9kEB5pqWpJw
1481,end of 2020 which some would say is a,4165.949,5.13,9kEB5pqWpJw
1482,weakness but they did pull out that,4168.92,4.02,9kEB5pqWpJw
1483,document at one point about here the NHS,4171.079,4.08,9kEB5pqWpJw
1484,being on the table which for later I've,4172.94,3.69,9kEB5pqWpJw
1485,been quite an effective argument it has,4175.159,5.16,9kEB5pqWpJw
1486,been but you know Johnson was absolutely,4176.63,6.959,9kEB5pqWpJw
1487,category but he will not allow,4180.319,5.49,9kEB5pqWpJw
1488,privatisation of the NHS as a result is,4183.589,4.67,9kEB5pqWpJw
1489,very deal and he went as far as he could,4185.809,6.75,9kEB5pqWpJw
1490,to dismiss the idea that American drug,4188.259,6.55,9kEB5pqWpJw
1491,companies will be given the kind of,4192.559,4.711,9kEB5pqWpJw
1492,access to the NHS which would drive up,4194.809,7.56,9kEB5pqWpJw
1493,prices but that is in a way Johnson's,4197.27,10.949,9kEB5pqWpJw
1494,weakest position interesting and,4202.369,7.35,9kEB5pqWpJw
1495,obviously it's not beautiful,4208.219,4.401,9kEB5pqWpJw
1496,lecture but they were asked about,4209.719,6.421,9kEB5pqWpJw
1497,whether the monarchy was before gaseous,4212.62,5.74,9kEB5pqWpJw
1498,what was really interesting was that,4216.14,5.4,9kEB5pqWpJw
1499,Jeremy Corbyn said room for improvement,4218.36,5.67,9kEB5pqWpJw
1500,and actually got some applause for the,4221.54,3.929,9kEB5pqWpJw
1501,world he'd said that before the prince a,4224.03,3.03,9kEB5pqWpJw
1502,country where sowed he might not have,4225.469,3.841,9kEB5pqWpJw
1503,thought the same exactly and it was very,4227.06,5.58,9kEB5pqWpJw
1504,interesting that when Joyce Johnson said,4229.31,6.51,9kEB5pqWpJw
1505,it's beyond reproach job now that,4232.64,7.23,9kEB5pqWpJw
1506,question that in that audience Corbin,4235.82,6.24,9kEB5pqWpJw
1507,had the better of that I'm not so sure,4239.87,5.16,9kEB5pqWpJw
1508,that in the country at large,4242.06,4.74,9kEB5pqWpJw
1509,Corbett's position on the monarchy will,4245.03,3.27,9kEB5pqWpJw
1510,be quite so popular obviously Prince,4246.8,3.63,9kEB5pqWpJw
1511,Andrew has changed the nature of the,4248.3,5.82,9kEB5pqWpJw
1512,debate that controversial interview but,4250.43,6.36,9kEB5pqWpJw
1513,I still think you know a majority of,4254.12,7.38,9kEB5pqWpJw
1514,British people broadly love the Queen so,4256.79,6.69,9kEB5pqWpJw
1515,I don't really know how that's gonna,4261.5,4.11,9kEB5pqWpJw
1516,play whether whether whether in the,4263.48,4.8,9kEB5pqWpJw
1517,country at large it'll play quite the,4265.61,5.25,9kEB5pqWpJw
1518,same way as it played in in that Hall,4268.28,4.919,9kEB5pqWpJw
1519,but I'd say the key thing it seemed,4270.86,6.45,9kEB5pqWpJw
1520,seems to me is that neither leader made,4273.199,6.741,9kEB5pqWpJw
1521,what I regard as a significant error,4277.31,5.55,9kEB5pqWpJw
1522,both actually were quite good on their,4279.94,5.97,9kEB5pqWpJw
1523,stronger point you know Johnson on,4282.86,7.98,9kEB5pqWpJw
1524,giving his deal done and call being on,4285.91,8.86,9kEB5pqWpJw
1525,public services particularly the NHS so,4290.84,5.55,9kEB5pqWpJw
1526,I guess they will both come out of it,4294.77,4.26,9kEB5pqWpJw
1527,feeling sort of okay he's scored rule,4296.39,7.579,9kEB5pqWpJw
1528,let's be kind of draw and we await the,4299.03,7.439,9kEB5pqWpJw
1529,manifestos and maybe that will change,4303.969,4.691,9kEB5pqWpJw
1530,the momentum all right thanks so much,4306.469,5.011,9kEB5pqWpJw
1531,she's gotta go fast now I think thanks,4308.66,3.3,9kEB5pqWpJw
